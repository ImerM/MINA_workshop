The project aims to introduce in-silico supported prevention, detection and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches for both new and emerging FF, based on spatial modelling across a wide range of spatial levels, novel decision support systems, and new knowledge regarding biological traits of the target species, fruit trading and socioeconomics. FF-IPM introduces a fundamental paradigm shift in IPM towards “OFF-Season” management of FF by targeting the overwintering generation when population undergoes significant bottlenecks, preventing, this way, population growth later in season. “ON-Season” control approaches will be generated for different spatial scales considering both existing and developed by FF-IPM tools and services. Innovative prevention tools to track FF infested fruit (e-Nose) and rapidly identify intercepted specimens (Rapid-Molecular-Pest-ID tools) in imported commodities and at processing industries will be produced. Species specific e-trapping systems for the three-target FF will be advanced and employed by novel detection strategies based on spatial modelling. Both “ON and OFF-Season” IPM approaches and detection strategies will be validated in selected locations in eight different countries. FF-IPM generated data on FF response under stress conditions, overwintering dynamics, establishment and dispersion patterns of low population densities combined with advanced spatial population modeling are expected to contribute towards understanding drivers of emerging and new pests under climate change scenarios.",6004252.5,6004252.5,H2020-SFS-2018-2,RIA,PANEPISTIMIO THESSALIAS,EL,UNIVERSITAT JAUME I DE CASTELLON;ANECOOP SOCIEDAD COOPERATIVA;INSTITUTO UNIVERSITARIO DE LISBOA;SVEUCILISTE U SPLITU;THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH ORGANISATION OF ISRAEL - THE VOLCANI CENTRE;E-NEMA GESELLSCHAFT FUER BIOTECHNOLOGIE UND BIOLOGISCHEN PFLANZENSCHUTZ mbH;SZYNISZEWSKA ANNA;OSTERREICHISCHE AGENTUR FUR GESUNDHEIT UND ERNAHRUNGSSICHERHEIT GMBH;CITRUS RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL (PTY)LTD;PCA TECHNOLOGIES SRL;MUSEE ROYAL DE L'AFRIQUE CENTRALE;BENAKI PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL INSTITUTE;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DEL MOLISE;R&DO LIMITED;CENTRE DE COOPERATION INTERNATIONALE EN RECHERCHE AGRONOMIQUE POUR LEDEVELOPPEMENT - C.I.R.A.D.

By combining and modulating non-thermal technologies with minimally processing operation, we will respond to consumers’ demand for fresh, healthy, convenient, sustainable and locally produced and additive-free food. The combined and optimised mild technologies will be demonstrated and validated in 2 business cases: Minimally processed fruits and vegetables and Fruit and vegetable-based juices & smoothies. Sanitization during washing will be optimized by applying in combination ultrasound (US), electrolysed water, plasma activated water, High Intensity Pulsed Light and Blue Light. Bioactive coating, active and intelligent packaging will be applied for quality preservation and shelf life extension of minimally processed F&V. F&V-based juices & smoothies will be stabilized by US and high pressure processing. For F&V by-product valorisation, US, pulsed electric field and membrane filtration will be used to extract bioactive compounds.
Sustainable and flexible processing methods will be transferred and adapted to the need of local F&V micro and SMEs, interconnecting primary producers through novel cooperative business models and new logistics systems, to enhance the traceability and authenticity of raw materials along the F&V value chain.

It will consolidate, activate and extend the current ecosystem by building a network of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) that will boost the uptake of digital solutions by the farming sector. This will be achieved by integrating technology and business support in a local one-stop-shop approach involving all regions and all relevant players in Europe. The heart of the project is formed by 28 flagship innovation experiments demonstrating digital innovations in agriculture, facilitated by DIHs from 9 Regional Clusters including all European member states. Concurrently, SmartAgriHubs will improve the maturity of innovation services of DIHs so that digital innovations will be replicated across Europe and widely adopted by European farmers. A lean multi-actor approach focusing on user acceptability, stakeholder engagement and sustainable business models will boost technology and market readiness levels and bring user adoption to the next level. This will be enhanced by synergetic effects between SmartAgriHubs and RIS3, since SmartAgriHubs will work in lock step with European regions to maximize the return of European investments, including regional structural funds and private capital. Open Calls with a total budget of ±6 M€ will expand the network and ensure that technological developments and emerging challenges of the agri-food sector are incorporated in the DIH service portfolio. SmartAgriHubs’ inclusive structure and ambitious targets will bring the entire European ecosystem together, connecting the dots to ensure global leadership for Europe in the AgTech market. The consortium, led by Wageningen Research and other partners of previous key projects such as IoF2020, FIWARE, S3P Agri-Food and I4MS, will leverage the existing ecosystem and guarantee a maximum ROI for European taxpayers and a vital agri-food sector producing adequate and safe food for future generations.",22423146,19999458.62,H2020-RUR-2018-1,IA,STICHTING WAGENINGEN RESEARCH,NL,"IRISH CATTLE BREEDING FEDERATION SOCIETY LTD;INF AGRI 85, AGRI 85, VENDEE AGRICOLE, RACINES;CYBERNETIC TECHNOLOGIES NETICTECH SPOLKA AKCYJNA;ZEMNIEKU SAEIMA;INNOVATION FOR AGRICULTURE;ART-ER-SOCIETA CONSORTILE PER AZIONI;LESPROJEKT SLUZBY SRO;INSTITUT FÜR ANGEWANDTE SYSTEMTECHNIK BREMEN GMBH;AGRI-DATASERVICES BIOSCOPE BV;MITTELDEUTSCHE AGENTUR FUR INFORMATIONSSERVICE GMBH;CFS CROSS FARM SOLUTION GMBH;AGROVAST LIVSMEDEL AKTIEBOLAG;ENERGY MONITORING IRELAND LIMITED;PRASIDENTENKONFERENZ DER LANDWIRTSCHAFTSKAMMERN OSTERREICHS;SMART AGRITECH SOLUTION OF SWEDEN AB;AUREA IMAGING BVBA;UNPARALLEL INNOVATION LDA;DNAPHONE SRL;EXOBOTIC TECHNOLOGIES;PROSPEH, POSLOVNE STORITVE IN DIGITALNE RESITVE DOO;NEUROPUBLIC AE PLIROFORIKIS & EPIKOINONION;WATERFORD INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO;GROUPE PROVENCE SERVICES;SCHUTTELAAR & PARTNERS, CONSULTANCY FOR FOOD AND LIFESCIENCES NV;CONSULAI, CONSULTORIA AGROINDUSTRIAL LDA;FUNDACION CENTRO TECNOLOXICO DE TELECOMUNICACIONS DE GALICIA;CONFEDERAZIONE NAZIONALE COLDIRETTI;GOTHIA REDSKAP & EKOVAXT AB;FARMDOK GMBH;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;VERVAEKE;BALTIC OPEN SOLUTIONS CENTER;AGRO BUSINESS PARK AS;SDRUZENIE BULGARSKA ASOCIACIA NA SOFTUERNITE KOMPANII BASCOM;INNOSEP GMBH;GRAINSENSE OY;UNIWERSYTET PRZYRODNICZY W POZNANIU;API AGRO;CAJAMAR CAJA RURAL SOCIEDAD COOPERATIVA DE CREDITO;NEMZETI AGRARKUTATASI ES INNOVACIOS KOZPONT;Région des Pays de la Loire;WIELKOPOLSKI OSRODEK DORADZTWA ROLNICZEGO W POZNANIU;EUROPEAN BUSINESS AND INNOVATION CENTRE NETWORK AISBL;AGRO INTELLIGENCE APS;MONET TECNOLOGIA E INNOVACION SL;STIENEN BEDRIJFSELEKTRONIKA BV;INSTYTUT CHEMII BIOORGANICZNEJ POLSKIEJ AKADEMII NAUK;CONSEJERIA DE AGRICULTURA , GANADERÍA, PESCA Y DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE;WIRELESSINFO;METEOBLUE AG;AVR BVBA;FARMHACKNL;EIGEN VERMOGEN VAN HET INSTITUUT VOOR LANDBOUW- EN VISSERIJONDERZOEK;ZUIDELIJKE LAND- EN TUINBOUWORGANISATIE VERENIGING;LUONNONVARAKESKUS;CODE PLUS LIMITED;INGENERA SA;ASTER - SOCIETA CONSORTILE PER AZIONI;CONSULTORES DE AUTOMATIZACION YROBOTICA SA;TEAGASC - AGRICULTURE AND FOOD DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY;AGRARGAZDASAGI KUTATO INTEZET;GRUPO HISPATEC INFORMATICA EMPRESARIAL SA;EDIA-EMPRESA DE DESENVOLVIMIENTO E INTRA-ESTRUTURAS DO ALQUEVA S.A.;NORDI GIUSEPPINO;TEKEVER II AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS LDA;SOUNDTALKS;GERHARDY HUBERT ERICH;HOEHERE BUNDESLEHR- UND FORSCHUNGSANSTALT FUER LANDWIRTSCHAFT, LANDTECHNIK UND LEBENSMITTELTECHNOLOGIE;SMARTRDI - SMART RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTERNATIONAL SRL;FEDERATIA NATIONALA A PRODUCATORILOR DIN AGRICULTURA INDUSTRIA ALIMENTARA SI SERVICII CONEXE DIN PRO AGRO;LANDWIRTSCHAFTSKAMMER NIEDERSACHSEN;Association de Coordination Technique Agricole;SERAGRO S.

To effectively implement energy and climate policies, concerted and strong action is needed. Municipalities often have ambitious goals and political will, but lack the harmonized, interdepartmental and long-term structures to successfully implement their climate and energy strategies and thus reach their goal.

This is the starting point for the project, which focuses on capacity building in municipalities. By introducing the quality management and certification programme European Energy Award (eea) in Belgium, Croatia, Greece and Poland, the project aims at setting up the necessary structures in municipalities. During the project, 30 pilot municipalities will further develop and implement their climate and energy strategy by using the eea standards and criteria catalogue. External advisors will guide and monitor the continuous progress. Its certification will ensure that municipalities implement their climate and energy plans to high quality standards. The certification process is ongoing and ensures that municipal climate action progress. Their experiences and successes will pave the way for more municipalities in the target regions to join the eea. 

IMPLEMENT’s objective is to set up the necessary structures for a long-term roll-out of the eea in the partner countries. Partners will translate and adapt all eea tools to national context, receive adequate training to become skilled eea advisors, able to advice and guide pilot municipalities through the eea process. The consortium together with regional authorities will develop, based on experience exchange with eea expert regions, feasibility studies and business plans, tailor-made support schemes for the participating countries.",1389615,1389615,H2020-EE-2016-CSA,CSA,BOND BETER LEEFMILIEU VLAANDEREN,BE,ENERGIAKO KE PERIVALONTIKO GRAFIO EGEOU;B. & S.U.

Nearly half of all mental disorders have an early onset before the age of 14 and often take a costly chronic course impacting social functioning, economic productivity as well as quality of life. Parenting interventions represent one approach to prevention of child mental health disorders, particular behavioral disorders, which could reduce the global burden of mental disorders in LMIC. However, addressing extending parenting intervention research to LMIC does not only require rigorous testing of the efficacy of interventions in new LMIC, but also requires increased attention to implementation, dissemination, and sustainability. This calls for a systematic empirical process that at a) adapts content and materials to the respective LMIC, b) tests the different components, c) subsequently, optimizes the intervention based on these initial results, and then d) re-tests the optimized intervention again while attending to broader contextual and economic influences. This is what we will propose for RISE. We will use an intervention that has been specifically designed for low resource settings and already been introduced and tested in other LMIC. The Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) is one of the first programs to provide early intervention parenting programs to prevent adverse childhood experiences and reduce child behavioral problems in LMIC. We plan to extend the program of research on PLH in three of the poorest countries in Europe where empirically-based prevention programs are in need of wide scale implementation. In RISE, we plan to innovatively combine the state-of-the art Multiphase Optimization Strategy for intervention research with a rigorous implementation science approach, which will allow RISE to make significant advances in the prevention of child behavioral disorders in Southeastern Europe.",2976092.25,2976092.25,H2020-SC1-2017-Single-Stage-RTD,RIA,UNIVERSITAET BREMEN,DE,"GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION INC;UNIVERSITATEA BABES BOLYAI;ASOCIATIA OBSTEASCA SANATATE PENTRU TINERI;UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET BRAUNSCHWEIG;INSTITUT ZA BILAKJ SEMEJSTVO I SISTEMSKA PRAKSA - ALTENATIVA;UNIVERSITAET KLAGENFURT;THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD;BANGOR UNIVERSITY",US;RO;MD;ZA;DE;MK;AT;UK,NA

There is a major focus on digitisation by EU and national/regional policy-makers to ensure that digital innovation in agriculture keeps pace with other sectors and the benefits of digitisation are available to the wider farming community. However, there is a danger that digitisation and future innovations will be hampered unless the rural advisory community is mobilised to take ownership of digital tools and to advocate at the user interface.  This CSA will engage, enable and empower the independent farm advisor community,  through sharing of tools, expertise and motivations. FAIRshare has two main programmes. Firstly, WPs 1, 2 and 3 will gather an evidence base of the digital tools and services used internationally, leveraging the social networks of partner institutions that span  EU and non-EU countries. The inventory of tools will be accessible to end-users on an intuitively navigable online interface that has been co-designed using a multi-actor approach. Accompanying the tools in the online inventory  will be information, for instance short ‘good practice’ vignettes, on how the tools may be used/adapted for use. Secondly, WPs 4, 5 and 6 will generate and resource a participatory ‘living laboratory’, empowering advisor peers from across the EU to interact with the online inventory and, in a series of workshops, to exchange, co-adapt, co-design and apply digital tools. The FAIRshare 'living lab’ will enable advisors to address challenges to embedding digital tools in different advisory and farming contexts across the EU.

Multiple stakeholders operate inside and outside them with different motivations and businesses. Although document and data interchange is already in place through Port Community Systems (PCS), the interchange is limited to official documentation and services of the Port Authority, such as custom declarations, import/export of cargo, and other formal documents. However, an effective integration of operational data is far from optimal in most ports, and especially so in medium or small ports, where budget is limited and IT services usually is outsourced.

In contrast, the available operational data (resources tracking, container status, vessel operations, surface or berth available, air/water quality measurements,...) is constantly increasing and technology is getting inexpensive and widely available. However, the application of such systems is still single-entity centric, since the information is not shared, keeping the real potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 hidden. The same holds for geographic areas surrounding ports, where Smart Cities  integrate various data systems and provide valuable services to citizens and  authorities.

PIXEL will enable a two-way collaboration of ports, multimodal transport agents and cities for optimal use of internal and external resources, sustainable economic growth and environmental impact mitigation, towards the Ports of the Future. PIXEL will leverage technological enablers to voluntary exchange data among ports and stakeholders, thus ensuring a measurable benefit in this process. The main outcome of this technology will be efficient use of resources in ports, sustainable development and green growth of ports and surrounding cities/regions.

The central objective is to foster and accelerate the shift towards collaborative short food supply chains and, through concrete actions and recommendations, to introduce new robust business models and innovative practical solutions that enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of the European agri-food system. 
Using bottom-up, demand-driven research, the SMARTCHAIN consortium i) will perform a multi-perspective analysis of 18 case studies of short food supply chains in terms of technological, regulatory, social, economic and environmental factors, ii) will assess the linkages and interactions among all stakeholders involved in short food supply chains and iii) will identify the key parameters that influence sustainable food production and rural development among different regions in Europe. 
The project aims to establish 9 national communities of short food supply chains (Innovation and Collaboration Hubs) in different partner countries (France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland) and a virtual innovation hub in order to facilitate stakeholder engagement, bringing farmers and consumers together in a trust-enhancing environment enabling them to generate demand driven-innovations.
Combination of scientific and practical knowledge and the use of innovation workshops will enable the development of practical innovative solutions as well as the promotion of a framework for different forms of collaborative short food supply chains in urban and rural areas.

While populism is a phenomenon that has by now emerged in almost every democracy, we believe that regional and cultural-historical dimensions need to be considered in order to improve not only scholarly knowledge, but also policy recommendations. It is urgent for Western Europeans to look into the CEE mirror, just as it is urgent for the CEE region to understand itself. To this end, we will create a typology of populism’s various manifestations, reconstruct trajectories of its growth and decline, investigate its causes, interpret its meanings, diagnose its consequences, and propose policy solutions.

Our focus is on CEE, but we engage in comparisons with populisms elsewhere, particularly Western Europe. While scholars from different disciplines have looked at populism, we argue that the full potential of interdisciplinary research has not been achieved yet. We draw on data and models from various disciplines and combine them into a rich study of forces at play. In addition to established methods of economics, sociology, and cultural studies, at the heart of our approach is a novel methodology whose essence is a large-scale, Europe-wide, multi-lingual online conversation. This is a listening exercise; its aim is a deep understanding of everyday life in Europe challenged by the rise of populism. The method to process this unique ethnographic material is semantic social network analysis.

POPREBEL relies on foresight/future studies, deep involvement with activists, policy makers, and civil society actors to boost the immune system of European democracy. We develop scenarios and share them with all interested parties to reflect, in public debate, on how well they fit both in the CEE region and the rest of Europe.

To meet this challenge, the automotive industry must shift mass production from thermal to electrified vehicles. The challenge is further complicated by electrified vehicles having more components and architectures than thermal vehicles. Realizing this paradigm shift is only possible if there are innovative methods to significantly reduce their development and testing time. 
The main goal of PANDA is to provide a unified organisation of digital models to seamlessly integrate virtual and real testing of all types of electrified vehicles and their components. The complexity of developing electrified vehicles becomes manageable by delivering a modular simulation framework. Development partners can share models (in open or in black-box form), avoiding sensitive IP issues and greatly increasing the development flexibility. The proposed method will enable 1) an easy reuse of models for different development tasks, 2) a replacement of real tests by virtual tests and 3) real-time testing on vehicle level. This method will be integrated in a multi-power open platform based on existing industrial software, enabling Stand-Alone or Cloud Computing. The method will be validated using two existing vehicles (a BEV and a FCV). Also, real and virtual tests of the integrated electrical subsystems of an innovative P-HEV will be performed.
PANDA will reduce the time-to-market of electrified vehicles by 20%, by harmonizing the interaction between the models. In addition, the seamless integration will give developers access to other subsystem models, which will decrease the correlation efforts on components by 20%. The open platform will 1) make it easier for OEMs, suppliers, SMEs and research institutions to interact and 2) enable a fair competition. These innovations will make the European market more flexible, more open to innovation and ultimately more competitive.",3488671.25,3488671.25,H2020-LC-GV-2018,RIA,UNIVERSITE DE LILLE,FR,"SIEMENS INDUSTRY SOFTWARE SRL;RENAULT TECHNOLOGIE ROUMANIES SRL;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL;UNIVERSITATEA TEHNICA CLUJ-NAPOCA;TAJFUN HIL DRUSTVO SA OGRANICENOM ODGOVORNOSCU ZA ISTRAZIVANJE, PROIZVODNJU, TRGOVINU I USLUGE NOVI SAD;UNIRESEARCH BV;BLUEWAYS INTERNATIONAL BVBA;COMMUNAUTE D' UNIVERSITES ET ETABLISSEMENTS UNIVERSITE BOURGOGNE - FRANCHE - COMTE;TUV SUD AG;VALEO EQUIPEMENTS ELECTRIQUES MOTEUR SAS",RO;BE;RS;NL;FR;DE,NA

ICT tools (relying on QR codes) will be developed as the driver of the proposed eco-innovative services to take full advantage of the potential and synergies of two major revolutions of our time: the circular economy and the Industry 4.0. The project will thus contribute to transform the E&E sector into circular and 4.0, raising new opportunities for end-users (such as their involvement in design or the access to a product as a service) and for social and solidarity economy (conducted by NGOs, like EMAUS, which employ people at risk of social exclusion to repair and prepare WEEE for re-use). The techno-economic, environmental and social viability of the new CEBMs will be validated through demonstrations dealing with four target products belonging to different EEE categories: large household appliances, IT equipment, telecommunications equipment, and consumer equipment.

African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of ASF, a highly contagious disease of domestic pigs which causes a haemorrhagic syndrome with up to 100% mortality. ASF is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and on the Italian island of Sardinia. In 2007 the disease was reported in Georgia. Since then it has spread to Russia, Ukraine, Poland and neighbouring countries. In 2017 outbreaks were reported in the Czech Republic and Romania. Wild boar are susceptible to ASFV and facilitate the continuing spread of the disease in Europe with regular spill-over into in-contact domestic pigs. 
The capripoxvirus Lumpy Skin Disease virus (LSDV) causes a classic systemic poxvirus disease in cattle and spreads rapidly in warm humid conditions, most likely due to insect-borne transmission. LSDV entered Europe, the Balkans and Caucasus for the first time in 2015. The ongoing epidemic has caused the deaths of thousands of cattle through mortality and eradication campaigns.

However, PG maintenance and functions are under threat from sub-optimal management of inputs, cultivation in higher output farming systems and abandonment in remote and marginal areas. The overall objective of the SUPER-G project is to co-develop sustainable PG systems and policies with farmers and policy makers that will be effective in optimising productivity, whilst supporting biodiversity and delivering a number of other ES.
SUPER-G will apply a multi-actor approach, working with farmers; land owners/managers and their advisers; third sector and civil society groups; non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and researchers, policy and business communities to achieve: 1) better understanding of the importance and functioning of PG; 2) benchmarking of PG performance across Europe; 3) co-development of integrated approaches for profitable and sustainable PG management; and 4) co-development of tools and policy mechanisms, which are inclusive of stakeholder and citizen priorities, to support the maintenance and sustainable management of PG. The project will last five years to allow time for the establishment of farm networks for data gathering and analysis; and the development of good grassland practices, innovative techniques and farm-level and policy support tools.
Using a responsible research and innovation (RRI) approach, the project will develop a comprehensive European grassland typology and a shared conceptual model of how PG can deliver in terms of productivity, biodiversity and other ES such as climate regulation, water quality, mediation of water flows and erosion control. The potential of PG to deliver multiple ES will be informed by benchmarking and testing, involving a network of farms and experimental platforms in 14 countries covering the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Continental, Alpine, Pannonian and Boreal regions.",9994996.83,9994996.83,H2020-SFS-2017-2,RIA,UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE,UK,"THE UNIVERSITY COURT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN;SZKOLA GLOWNA GOSPODARSTWA WIEJSKIEGO;CONSULAI, CONSULTORIA AGROINDUSTRIAL LDA;RSK ADAS LIMITED;GEORG-AUGUST-UNIVERSITAT GOTTINGENSTIFTUNG OFFENTLICHEN RECHTS;AGRIFOOD AND BIOSCIENCES INSTITUTE;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI TORINO;ASS DE LA FERME EXPERIMENTALE;SVERIGES LANTBRUKSUNIVERSITET;UNIVERSIDAD DE CORDOBA;CHAMBRE REGIONALE D'AGRICULTURE DE NORMANDIE;EIDGENOESSISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE ZUERICH;THE NOTHERN IRELAND AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL;CRA GRAND EST;JAVNA USTANOVA UNIVERZITET CRNE GORE PODGORICA;UNIVERZA V LJUBLJANI;MAGYAR TUDOMANYOS AKADEMIA OKOLOGIAI KUTATOKOZPONT;STICHTING WAGENINGEN RESEARCH;MENDELOVA UNIVERZITA V BRNE",UK;PL;PT;DE;IT;FR;SE;ES;CH;ME;SI;HU;NL;CZ,NA

LIV:IN builds on the premise that recognition of the value of RRI among industry is necessary for achieving the aim of the call “to progress further in integrating RRI in industrial contexts”. The project follows an opportunity oriented approach in order to 

(1) activate industry leaders, experts and citizens to experiment with responsible ways of co-creating innovations; 
(2) build capacity for RRI implementation and develop tools that are applicable across industry sectors; and 
(3) transform attitudes towards RRI from risk to opportunity.

LIV:IN will demonstrate the added value of RRI in the area of smart future living. We carefully selected this application area because it directly impacts the lives of citizens (societal relevance) but also constitutes a major emerging market (business opportunity). The project includes four key features that will significantly enhance the quality of the proposed coordination and support activities. First, six LIV:IN Labs and a virtual community of practice will constitute the central spaces for experimentation with integrating RRI in industry, and, consequently, the development of new approaches to innovation. Second, the application and continuous improvement of RRI tools in these spaces will contribute to capacity-building among industry and citizens alike. Third, embedded audio-visual story-telling will be the main vehicle for disseminating results and for shifting attitudes towards RRI from risk to opportunity. Finally, continuous dialogue with earlier and present initiatives in the areas of RRI, CSR and open innovation will ensure the transferability of project results across industry sectors. Ultimately, LIV:IN is guided by its vision to become a flagship initiative for effective integration of RRI in industry.",3549475,3549475,H2020-SwafS-2017-1,CSA,WIRTSCHAFTSUNIVERSITAT WIEN,AT,ISTITUTO DI STUDI PER L'INTEGRAZIONE DEI SISTEMI (I.S.I.S) - SOCIETA'COOPERATIVA;ERICSSON NIKOLA TESLA D.D.;INFINEON TECHNOLOGIES AUSTRIA  AG;STICHTING SMART HOMES;DE MONTFORT UNIVERSITY;DIALOGIK GEMEINNUETZIGE GESELLSCHAFT FUER KOMMUNIKATIONS- UND KOOPERATIONSFORSCHUNG mbH;ATOS SPAIN SA;FUNDACION BANCARIA CAIXA D'ESTALVISI PENSIONS DE BARCELONA LA CAIXA;TELEFONICA MOVILES ESPANA SA;SIVECO ROMANIA SA;COMARCH SA;OTTOBOCK SE & CO.

This approach captures synergies across needs and sources of flexibilities, such as multiple services from one source, or hybridizing sources, thus resulting in a cost-efficient power system. OSMOSE proposes four TSO-led demonstrations (RTE, REE, TERNA and ELES) aiming at increasing the techno-economic potential of a wide range of flexibility solutions and covering several applications, i.e.: synchronisation of large power systems by multiservice hybrid storage; multiple services provided by the coordinated control of different storage and FACTS devices; multiple services provided by grid devices, large demand-response and RES generation coordinated in a smart management system; cross-border sharing of flexibility sources through a near real-time cross-border energy market.    
The demonstrations are coordinated with and supported by simulation-based studies which aim (i) to forecast the economically optimal mix of flexibility solutions in long-term energy scenarios (2030 and 2050) and (ii) to build recommendations for improvements of the existing market mechanisms and regulatory frameworks, thus enabling the reliable and sustainable development of flexibility assets by market players in coordination with regulated players.       
Interoperability and improved TSO/DSO interactions are addressed so as to ease the scaling up and replication of the flexibility solutions.

NEFERTITI focuses on creating added value from the exchange of knowledge, actors, farmers and technical content over the networks in order to boost innovation uptake, to improve peer to peer learning and network connectivity between farms actors across Europe, thus contributing to a more competitive, sustainable and climate-smart agriculture.
NEFERTITI address 10 themes that have been chosen based on key concerns of the farming communities of the regional hubs in the project, covering together a balanced range of themes over three main agricultural sectors: animal production, arable farming and horticultural production. The themes have also been chosen regarding their innovation potential, their demonstration potential and the cross-fertilisation potential among the themes, the sectors and the actors. Themes are closely linked to the H2020 Thematic Networks and will connect with other organisational structures at grass root level, like EIP operational groups and study clubs that will confer to the project a key role of accelerator and empowerment of the dissemination and of the uptake of the practical-oriented knowledge delivered by all EIP related projects.
A monitoring and learning program supports the systematic extraction of lessons learnt, lessons to be shared with wide audiences including AKIS actors and public authorities. A web based platform unlocks the experience, actors, demo details and the related content for wide spread sharing, enhanced by dedicated production of relevant material (including high-quality professional videos) in each language of the partners.

The starting point of the proposal is the serious lack of medicines for children in EU and worldwide as well as the lack of a development model for paediatric medicines that integrates technology-driven aspects with clinical trials. The design for this new RI will be based on the following main pillars: 
- to harness efficiency and delivery of paediatric research activities and services strengthening collaboration within the scientific paediatric community;
- to be a complementary RI in the context of the existing RIs covering the current gaps, while avoiding any duplication;
- to contribute to a one-stop-shop for advice in paediatric drug development;
- to develop a paediatric research infrastructure facility collaborating with already established Research Infrastructures and Common Services. 
To prepare a valuable Conceptual Design Report (CDR), the project encompasses three phases. During the Context Analysis phase, that will be performed in 5 technical and scientific domains (1-Paediatric Medicines Discovery and Preclinical Studies, 2-Biomarkers, 3-Paediatric Pharmacology, 4-Formulation Science, 5-Underpinning Paediatric Studies) the perceived value and the possible gaps to be covered will be estimated by enquiring the scientific Communities, the concerned national Authorities and many other Stakeholders.
During the Operational phase, the different components of the new RI will be organised including governance model strategies for interaction with national Authorities and the existing RIs, the IT-architecture model, services to be provided and a business plan. 
In the second year, a Feasibility phase is proposed to develop virtual exercises simulating the operations of the RI.

Its objective is 1) to implement New Plant Breeding Techniques (NPBTs) in chicory in order to establish it as a multipurpose crop for the production of health-related products with clear benefits for consumers, and 2) to develop co-innovation pathways with stakeholders for game-changing technologies, such as NPBTs. 
CHIC will develop four different NPBTs. They will be used to steer bioprocesses in chicory and mobilize its under-explored potential to produce immunomodulatory prebiotics and medicinal terpenes. The conceptually different NPBTs will be assessed with respect to technological potential, risks, regulatory framework and their socio-economic impacts. This will be done in close consultation with a Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG) composed of relevant stakeholders in industry and society. Ongoing project activities and results will be discussed with stakeholders and communicated to interested public using innovative methods including cultural communication and linking art to science. In this context, CHIC will develop two business cases in different application areas, inulin as healthy food ingredient and terpenes as medicinal lead compounds. 
This effort requires a highly interdisciplinary approach with expertise from molecular sciences, economy, arts, social sciences & humanities, and legislation. The partnership includes three SMEs and a chicory end-user, and international collaboration is established via a research institute in New Zealand. The SAG plays a crucial role in consultation in all phases and activities of the project.

The infrastructure developed by ECDP will subsequently coordinate the first Europe wide cohort survey, which we name EuroCohort.  

This is achieved through the following three objectives: i. Building support from key political policy makers with a brief which covers child well-being as well as national funding agencies tasked with infrastructural spending on science and survey data collection ii. Develop a scientifically excellent research design iii. Establish a robust operational framework that will ensure the logistic integrity of EuroCohort.

The culmination of ECDP is in the creation of an infrastructural platform with a commitment from key stakeholders across Europe and from which the next stages in finalising EuroCohort can begin. 

There is at present no equivalent data source available to scientists to comparatively analyse the well-being of children as they grow up and therefore to develop policies to improve their well-being.  As the respondents to EuroCohort grow up an increasing body of data will develop, becoming ever richer and informative, able to show the ways in which national policies have made impacts and showing where policy interventions can make significant improvements.  

ECDP has a tripartite focus on securing political support, operational robustness and scientific excellence.  We recognise that each of these imperatives are necessary to the development of a successful research infrastructure, as scientific excellence alone is not enough.

It will bring about orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency, performance, reliability, security, and productivity in the design and programming of Systems of Artificial Intelligence that incorporate Smart Cyber Physical Systems while solving a chicken-egg problem for organizations who lack access to Data and Models. It’s open software architecture will facilitate adoption of the whole concept on a wider scale. 

It aims to address one of the most significant trends in the Internet of Things which is the shifting balance between edge computing and cloud computing. The early days of the IoT have been characterized by the critical role of cloud platforms as application enablers. Intelligent systems have largely relied on the cloud level for their intelligence, and the actual devices of which they consist have been relatively unsophisticated.

The project will utilize the experience of different actors and involve practitioner partners throughout the project to deepen understanding of effective on farm demonstration activities (multi-actor approach). In a first step, we will conduct a geo-referenced inventory of open commercial farms that engage in demonstration activities in Europe, detailing the sectors, themes and topics on which they provide expertise, and describe the mediation techniques they apply. Case studies will be selected to perform an in-depth comparative analysis. Important dimensions in selection are: 1) a wide-spread geo-graphical coverage within Europe, 2) representative for EU-agricultural sectors, systems and territories and 3) low tech versus high tech in mediation techniques. Case studies will be described, analysed and compared on 1) their network structure (actors, roles and governance characteristics), and 2) the mechanisms and tools used for recruitment, interaction and learning. Furthermore, effectiveness of the different approaches within the case-studies will be assessed through an evaluation of the extent and nature of learning. Both regional and international multi-actor meetings will use the results of the cross comparative case study analysis to i) identify a set of best practical approaches for both the on farm demonstration of research results (science driven) and the spreading of best farming practices among practitioners (innovation driven) and ii) recommendations for AKIS governance and policies on how to support effective on farm demonstration activities. The empowerment of both the commercial farming and policy community to uptake these best practices will occur through structuring the project results and farm demo showcases on the AgriDemo-Hub, an interactive, user oriented, web-map application.",1985363.75,1985363.75,H2020-RUR-2016-1,CSA,EIGEN VERMOGEN VAN HET INSTITUUT VOOR LANDBOUW- EN VISSERIJONDERZOEK,BE,IDEELLA FORENINGEN ODLING I BALANS MED FIRMA ODLING I BALANS;UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE;CENTRUM DORADZTWA ROLNICZEGO W BRWINOWIE;OSTERREICHISCHE AGENTUR FUR GESUNDHEIT UND ERNAHRUNGSSICHERHEIT GMBH;UNIVERSIDAD DE SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA;ZUIDELIJKE LAND- EN TUINBOUWORGANISATIE VERENIGING;TEAGASC - AGRICULTURE AND FOOD DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY;SEGES PS;EUROPEAN LANDOWNERS ORGANIZATION;AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS;FEDERACION EFA GALICIA;BIOSENSE INSTITUTE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN BIOSYSTEMS;LANDBRUG & FODEVARER F.M.B.A.;ASSOCIATION DES CHAMBRES D'AGRICULTURE DE L'ARC ATLANTIQUE,SE;UK;PL;AT;ES;NL;IE;DK;BE;EL;RS;FR,NA

The concept of the action is to develop a EU reference framework for establish operational synergies between Horizon 2020 and the European Structural and Investment Funds related to Circular Economy by:
a) Sustaining the regional actors’ participation at H2020 
The mechanism of the “vouchers”, already adopted in the past, will be reinforced an harmonized, in order to ensure common rules in EU regions and therefore encouraging to composition of international Consortia applying for circular economy projects related to the regional Smart Specialisation.
b) Encouraging the entrepreneurial initiatives based on H2020 project’s results 
The participating Regions will agree about a specific rule in their Structural Funds giving an advantage for those initiatives targeted to the exploitation of the H2020 project results with a circular economy approach.
c) Investigating the possibility of maximizing the H2020 investment through a “recovery”(fully or partial) of well ranked unfinanced proposals dealing with circular economy
Even if there is a clear presence of several bureaucratic and operational barriers, a possible solution could  have an impressive multiplier effect on the H2020 results.
The approach of the action is to leverage on growing industry sectors in EU regions to act as a driver also for the less performing ones, through a circular economy approach, and to support the emergence of new actors in the regional economies leading to new or redesigned value chains.",1742747.5,1742747.5,H2020-CIRC-2016OneStage,CSA,REGIONE LAZIO,IT,"Provincie Limburg;PIRKANMAAN LIITTO;WOJEWODZTWO LODZKIE;COMUNIDAD FORAL DE NAVARRA - GOBIERNO DE NAVARRA;INSTITUT D'AMENAGEMENT ET D'URBANISME DE LA REGION D'ILE DE FRANCE;FUNDO REGIONAL PARA A CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA;PRIMORSKO - GORANSKA ZUPANIJA;PROVINCIE FRYSLAN;REGIONE LOMBARDIA;CONSEJERIA DE MEDIOAMBIENTE Y RURAL, POLITICAS AGRARIAS Y TERRITORIO - JUNTA DE EXTREMADURA;KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER NETWORK LIMITED;Agentia pentru Dezvoltare Regionala Nord-Est;KRITI;VLAAMSE GEWEST;COMISSAO DE COORDENACAO E DESENVOLVIMENTO REGIONAL DO CENTRO;OBSERVATOIRE REGIONAL DES DECHETS D'ILE DE FRANCE;NEXA - AGENCE REGIONALE DE DEVELOPPEMENT D'INVESTISSEMENT ET D'INNOVATION;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DELLA TUSCIA",NL;FI;PL;ES;FR;PT;HR;IT;UK;RO;EL;BE,NA

HL increases the risk of cognitive decline, mental illness, and depression, and leads to social isolation, unemployment/early retirement, loss of income and work discrimination. 
The pre-eminent management strategy for HL is the provision of Hearing Aids (HAs), although their use is often problematic, costly and with poor overall benefits.
The holistic management of HL requires appropriate public health policies for HL prevention, early diagnosis, long-term treatment and rehabilitation; detection and prevention of cognitive decline; protection from noise; and socioeconomic inclusion of HL patients. However, currently the evidential basis for forming such policies is limited. Holistic HL management policies require the analysis of heterogeneous data, including HA usage, noise (TTS) episodes, audiological, physiological, cognitive, clinical and medication, personal, behavioural, life style, occupational and environmental data.

EVOTION has access to big datasets of such data from five different organisations and will support their continuous update by real time data produced by sensors and HAs used by HL patients. 

To utilise these data in forming holistic HL management policies, EVOTION aims to develop an integrated platform supporting: (a) the analysis of the above datasets to enable the identification of causal and other effects amongst them, (b) policy decision making focusing on the selection of effective interventions related to the holistic management of HL, based on the outcomes of (a) and the formulation of related public health policies, and (c) the specification and monitoring of such policies in a sustainable manner. To achieve this aim, EVOTION also brings together public health policy organisations, experts and authorities supporting the formation of the targeted policies and the validation of the EVOTION support for it.",5421901.25,4963776.25,H2020-SC1-2016-CNECT,RIA,OTICON A/S,DK,ATHENS TECHNOLOGY CENTER ANONYMI BIOMICHANIKI EMPORIKI KAI TECHNIKI ETAIREIA EFARMOGON YPSILIS TECHNOLOGIAS;ETHNIKO KAI KAPODISTRIAKO PANEPISTIMIO ATHINON;ZAVOD ZA JAVNO ZDRAVSTVO OSJECKO-BARANJSKE ZUPANIJE USTANOVA;EMPELOR GMBH;CITY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON;INSTYTUT MEDYCYNY PRACY IMIENIA PROF.

The project proposes, in a close to operational environment and in fully representative operational conditions, a set of tightly coordinated development and demonstration actions of key airborne and ground stakeholders in Europe.
The airborne industry will develop up to certification the worldwide first airborne unit capable of downlinking ADS-C data according to ATN Baseline 2 standard in compliance with PCP AF#6 (Initial Trajectory Information Sharing).
The ANSPs and ground industry will build up pre-operational system platforms capable of receiving and processing ADS-C data including the Extended Projected Profile (EPP). These platforms will e.g. display the shared trajectory data to controllers on their working positions and integrate it in the Flight data Processing systems for the enhancement of the ground Trajectory Prediction.
DIGITS plans to have revenue flights becoming available gradually as from mid 2018. These commercial flights will downlink ADS-C data to be processed in ATM ground systems of four participating ANSPs, covering together a substantial part of European airspace and air traffic under a variety of operational conditions. 
Demonstrations will be done in a shadow mode system set-up, supported by further offline analysis and post-processing. Project partners will make significant efforts to assess together with operational experts the benefits of initial trajectory sharing, its system impacts, potential human performance impacts and opportunities for further ATM performance improvements.
DIGITS will bridge the gap between the early validation of the Trajectory Based Operations concept achieved in SESAR 1, also known as “initial 4D”, with successful flight trials in 2012 and 2014, and the deployment of PCP AF#6.

Oddly enough, the low availability has almost always been due to control issues and hybridisation strategies rather than problems in the fuel cells themselves.

Giantleap aims to increase the availability and reduce the total cost of ownership of FCEBs by increasing the lifetime and reliability of the fuel cell system; this will be achieved with advanced online diagnostics of the fuel cells and the balance-of-plant components of the system, coupled with prognostics methods to calculate the system's residual useful life, and advanced control algorithms able to exploit this information to maximise the system's life.
The same control system will also be engineered for robustness, in order to increase availability to the level of diesel buses or better.

Giantleap will improve the understanding of degradation in fuel-cell systems with extensive experimentation and analysis; diagnostic and prognostic methods will focus on exploitation of current sensors to make the novel control approach cost-effective.
Giantleap includes the demonstration of a prototype in relevant environment, allowing the project to reach technology readiness level 6.

Although there is a proliferative development of logistics-related data stores, information channels, information management systems and data mining facilities, with both international and intermodal focus, this multitude of solutions exhibits a high degree of fragmentation, due to differences in user requirements, data models, system specification and business models. This legacy situation severely hampers the optimal use of logistics-related information.
 
To overcome this fragmentation and lack of connectivity of ICT-based information systems for logistics decision making, AEOLIX will establish a cloud-based collaborative logistics ecosystem for configuring and managing (logistics-related) information pipelines. This digital business ecosystem will create visibility across the supply chain, enabling more sustainable and efficient transport of goods cross Europe. An essential element of the approach is to ensure that for logistics actors connecting to and using the ecosystem in undemanding and has a low level of complexity.  We envision the ecosystem enabling the integration of supply-chain-related transport business processes through logistics software solutions for cloud-based connectivity and interaction, in order to support more efficient collaboration in the logistics supply chain than exists today.
 
By enabling low-complexity and low cost connectivity of local ICT platforms and systems and thereby scalable, trusted and secure exchange of information, AEOLIX will improve the overall competitiveness of goods transport in the supply chain, while simultaneously targeting sustainability from environmental, economic and social perspectives.",16220106.25,16220106.25,H2020-MG-2015_TwoStages,RIA,EUROPEAN ROAD TRANSPORT TELEMATICS IMPLEMENTATION COORDINATION ORGANISATION - INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS & SERVICES EUROPE,BE,"TX LOGISTIK AG;EMPORIKO KAI VIOMICHANIKO EPIMELITIRIO THESSALONIKI;OMOSPONDIA FORTIGON AYTOKINITON ELLADAS;HAMBURG PORT AUTHORITY;NOVACOM SERVICES SA;GIVENTIS INTERNATIONAL BV;ETHNIKO KENTRO EREVNAS KAI TECHNOLOGIKIS ANAPTYXIS;BUNDESVERBAND GUTERKRAFTVERKEHR LOGISTIK UND ENTSORGUNG BGL EV;MONDELEZ EUROPEAN BUSINESS SERVICES CENTRE SRO;Via donau – Österreichische Wasserstraßen-Gesellschaft mbH;SYNDESMOS EXAGOGEON VORIOU ELLADOS;THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHAMPTON HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION;NTEX AB;STICHTING SMART FREIGHT CENTRE;CONSORZIO INTERUNIVERSITARIO PER L'OTTIMIZZAZIONE E LA RICERCA OPERATIVA;MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE, TRANSPORT AND NETWORKS;TERMINAL INTERMODALE DI TRIESTE FERNETTI SPA;PTV PLANUNG TRANSPORT VERKEHR AG.;FUNDACION PARA LA PROMOCION DE LA INNOVACION, INVESTIGACION Y DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO EN LA INDUSTRIA DE AUTOMOCION DE GALICIA;FUNDACION CLUSTER DE EMPRESAS DE AUTOMOCION DE GALICIA;AUSTRIATECH - GESELLSCHAFT DES BUNDES FUR TECHNOLOGIEPOLITISCHE MASSNAHMEN GMBH;ATOS SPAIN SA;T-SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL GMBH;J.A.M.

Where other modes of transport benefit from the economy of series production, this is not the case for maritime products which are typically designed to refined customer requirements increasingly determined by the need for high efficiency, flexibility and low environmental impact at a competitive price. Product design is thus subject to global trade-offs among traditional constraints (customer needs, technical requirements, cost) and new requirements (life-cycle, environmental impact, rules).
One of the most important design objectives is to minimise total cost over the economic life cycle of the product, taking into account maintenance, refitting, renewal, manning, recycling, environmental footprint, etc. The trade-off among all these requirements must be assessed and evaluated in the first steps of the design process on the basis of customer / owner specifications. 
Advanced product design needs to adapt to profound, sometimes contradicting requirements and assure a flexible and optimised performance over the entire life-cycle for varying operational conditions. This calls for greatly improved design tools including multi-objective optimisation and finally virtual testing of the overall design and its components.
HOLISHIP (HOLIstic optimisation of SHIP design and operation for life-cycle) addresses these urgent industry needs by the development of innovative design methodologies, integrating design requirements (technical constraints, performance indicators, life-cycle cost, environmental impact) at an early design stage and for the entire life-cycle in an integrated design environment. Design integration will be implemented in practice by the development of integrated design s/w platforms and demonstrated by digital mock-ups and industry led application studies on the design and performance of ships, marine equipment and maritime assets in general.",11431746,11431746,H2020-MG-2015_TwoStages,RIA,HAMBURGISCHE SCHIFFBAU-VERSUCHSANSTALT GMBH,DE,"DNV GL HELLAS SA;SCHEEPSWERF DAMEN GORINCHEM BV;VAN DER VELDEN MARINE SYSTEMS BV;UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE;FRIENDSHIP SYSTEMS AG;BUREAU VERITAS MARINE & OFFSHORE REGISTRE INTERNATIONAL DE CLASSIFICATION DE NAVIRES ET DE PLATEFORMES OFFSHORE;NAVANTIA S.A.;SOCIETE D'INGENIERIE DE RECHERCHESET D'ETUDES EN HYDRODYNAMIQUE NAVALE;NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO;SINTEF OCEAN AS;AVEVA GMBH;NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS - NTUA;ROLLS-ROYCE POWER ENGINEERING PLC;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;BUREAU VERITAS - REGISTRE INTERNATIONAL DE CLASSIFICATION DE NAVIRES ET D'AERONEFS;DANAOS SHIPPING COMPANY LIMITED;NAVAL GROUP;KONGSBERG MARITIME CM AS;FINCANTIERI SPA;DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUER LUFT - UND RAUMFAHRT EV;BALANCE TECHNOLOGY CONSULTING GMBH;EPSILON MALTA LIMITED;CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE;CETENA S.p.A.

The socio-economic impact of tourism is extraordinary and urban tourism, but it brings at the same time a range of negative externalities, including high levels of unsustainable resource consumption and waste production. In comparison with other cities, tourist cities have to face additional challenges related to waste prevention and management due to their geographical and climatic conditions, the seasonality of tourism flow and the specificity of tourism industry and of tourists as waste producers. 

UrBAN-WASTE will support policy makers in answering these challenges and in developing strategies that aim at reducing the amount of municipal waste production and at further support the re-use, recycle, collection and disposal of waste in tourist cities. In doing so UrBAN-WASTE will adopt and apply the urban metabolism approach to support the switch to a circular model where waste is considered as resource and reintegrated in the urban flow. 

UrBAN-WASTE will perform a metabolic analysis of the state of art of urban metabolism in 11 pilot cities. In parallel a participatory process involving all the relevant stakeholders will be set up through a mobilization and mutual learning action plan. These inputs will be integrated in the strategies along with a review of the most innovative existing technologies and practices in the field of waste management and prevention.

In order to bring valorisation to a higher level, all relevant actors need to cooperate in an equal setting: co-creation. Co-creation transcends boundaries, but it does not happen naturally. Therefore, the ACCOMPLISSH consortium, consisting of 14 universities from 12 countries (representing all the sub disciplines in SSH), will actively involve the other partners from the so called Quadruple Helix (industry, governments and societal partners) within the project. The project has chosen an Open Innovation approach. 

The ACCOMPLISSH project (Accelerate co-creation by setting up a multi-actor platform for impact from Social Sciences and Humanities) will create a platform for dialogue where not only universities are involved. The dialogue platform is organised in such a way that academia, industry, governments and societal partners equally contribute in identifying barriers and enablers of co-creation. The results from both practice and the theory of co-creation form the basis of the valorisation concept and will be tested in the project in a quadruple helix setting. This concept will be tested and developed in such a way that it is transferable, scalable and customized for academia, industry, governments and societal partners in the whole of Europe. 

The impact profile of SSH research could be far stronger and more visible than it currently is. There are significant barriers to the valorisation of SSH research which still need to be understood in detail. In order to push the envelope within universities, we acknowledge that next to SSH researchers, the research support officers are key players in valorisation of SSH research.

Even though preventive measures are in place to reduce the incidence of stroke, the number of persons having a stroke in Europe is likely to increase from 1.1 million/year in 2000 to more than 1.5 million/year in 2025 because of the increasing ageing population. Secondary stroke carries with it a greater risk than first-ever stroke for death and disability. Also, as mortality from first strokes has decreased recently, the number of people at risk for a secondary stroke has increased, with an associated increase in healthcare costs. In order to reduce these stroke statistics and the associated cost, the self-management of stroke risk factors is particularly suitable and necessary for the following reasons: 1) risk factors for stroke are well-known, and 2) 90% of strokes or secondary stroke events are preventable if the risk factors are managed appropriately. The Decision SupporT and self-mAnagement system for stRoke survivoRs (STARR) project and the system developed in it are targeting the self-management of stroke risk factors. Based on existing computational predictive models of stroke risk, we will develop a modular, affordable, and easy-to-use system, which will inform stroke survivors about the relation between their daily activities (e.g., medication intake, physical and cognitive exercises, diet, social contacts) and the risk of having a secondary stroke. This will lead to better prevention and a reduction of the number of secondary stroke events, as well as to a more efficient participation of patients in medical decision-making.

The Commission has also the task of monitoring the impacts of the measures to check that the EU is on track with its 2020 target. 

The objective of the ODYSSEE MURE 2015 proposal is to contribute to this monitoring:

•	By updating two comprehensive databases covering each EU MS; ODYSSEE on energy consumption and energy efficiency indicators, and MURE on energy efficiency measures;
•	By providing new and innovative trainings and didactical documents to national, regional and local administrations in EU MS to raise their capacity and expertise in the field of energy efficiency monitoring and impact evaluation.
•	By extending the evaluation of the impact of energy efficiency from energy and CO2 savings, as already done in ODYSSEE, to the multiple other benefits.

The updating of two databases ODYSSEE and MURE will play a key role to provide updated and centralized information required by each MS and the Commission to assess, monitor and evaluate energy efficiency progress and the state of implementation of measures and their impact.

The project will provide innovative training tools and documents in a very user friendly way to public administrations to help them in implementing the monitoring of the progress achieved with indicators, in designing new policy measures and assessing the impacts of these measures, not only in terms of energy savings, but also in terms of the other benefits linked to energy efficiency improvements.

European coverage:
In each country the barriers to, and the potential value and benefits from, membership will be examined, and existing relevant infrastructure mapped.  Bespoke coordination, networking activities, and stakeholder forums, all designed to address the specific barriers, will be delivered.  In particular, relationships between national ministries, Research Councils, and the social science research community will be built.  Relevant work in other completed initiatives (eg. SERSCIDA, DASISH, DwB) would be taken up and moved to the next stage of practical and direct support for achieving membership of the CESSDA Research Infrastructure.  National opportunities for using European structural funds and other sources of support will be explored. The approach is to ensure the national and European economic and social benefits, and the positive returns on investment, that are achieved through membership of CESSDA are wholly apparent to the relevant national decision-makers.

Strength and sustainability :
The widened membership must form a strong and sustained network, where global best practice is built in to the infrastructure of European social science and research. Membership of CESSDA should mean membership of a world class support infrastructure. Links with practical benefits will be established with equivalent infrastructures in other continents. The benefits of coordinated collaboration and consultation with trans-national European stakeholders (for example, Eurostat, European Parliament, Consilium) will bring benefits to all national CESSDA Members. The visibility of this research infrastructure and its importance to excellent evidence in policy making will be enhanced.

Still, treatment is based on criteria established in the 90s that do not take into account the molecular evolution we have witnessed since, nor the introduction of new medication, leading to remarkably high unnecessary surgical treatment while missing most patients at risk. 
TAXINOMISIS will provide novel disease mechanism-based stratification for carotid artery disease patients to address the needs for stratified and personalised therapeutic interventions in the current era. This will be achieved through (1) the dissection of mechanisms mediating carotid artery disease, and identification of susceptibility and protection factors of plaque erosion and/or rupture using longitudinal cohorts and multi-omics, (2) the definition of distinct disease phenotypes and endotypes, and generation of molecular fingerprints of high versus low-risk states through systems medicine, (3) the development of a multilevel risk prediction model of the symptomatic plaque incorporating new biomarkers and advanced imaging, implemented in a software, to assist patient stratification and clinical decision making, (4) the development of novel pharmacogenomics solutions based on lab-on-a-chip technology to support personalized treatment, (5) the evaluation of the new risk prediction model and lab-on-a-chip device in a prospective observational clinical study, and (6) the assessment of regulatory, cost-effectiveness and ethical issues towards the implementation and commercialization of the programme’s outcomes.
TAXINOMISIS has therefore the potential to rationally change the current state-of-the-art in the stratification of patients with carotid artery disease by reducing unnecessary operations, refining medical treatment and opening up new avenues for therapeutic intervention, while strengthening the European biotechnology sector.",5999402.5,5999402.5,H2020-SC1-2017-Two-Stage-RTD,RIA,PANEPISTIMIO IOANNINON,EL,"ISTRAZIVACKO RAZVOJNI CENTAR ZA BIOINZENJERING BIOIRC DOO;Fair Dynamics Consulting s.r.l.;STICHTING NEDERLANDS INSTITUUT VOOR ONDERZOEK VAN DE GEZONDHEIDSZORG;ETHNIKO KAI KAPODISTRIAKO PANEPISTIMIO ATHINON;PIRKANMAA HOSPITAL DISTRICT;INTERUNIVERSITAIR MICRO-ELECTRONICA CENTRUM;FACULTY OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE;EUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR CARDIOVASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY;IDRYMA IATROVIOLOGIKON EREUNON AKADEMIAS ATHINON;ZORA BIOSCIENCES OY;FUNDACIO CLINIC PER A LA RECERCA BIOMEDICA;UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM UTRECHT;IRCCS OSPEDALE POLICLINICO SAN MARTINO;KLINIKUM RECHTS DER ISAR DER TECHNISCHEN UNIVERSITAT MUNCHEN;THE CHANCELLOR, MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD;ENGINEERING - INGEGNERIA INFORMATICA SPA",RS;IT;NL;EL;FI;BE;CH;ES;DE;UK,NA

Therefore, the lack of knowledge on the influence of the material quality on the load bearing capacity of the final product hinders the industrial exploitation of AM, preventing this powerful technology from being confidently used in every-day manufacturing processes, in particular in low developed European countries.
The overall objective of the SIRAMM project is to significantly strengthen research in the AM field at the Polytechnical University of Timisoara (UPT, Romania). To achieve this aim, SIRAMM will build upon the existing science and innovation base of UPT, creating a network with two internationally-leading counterparts at EU level: Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Norway) and the University of Parma (Italy).
In the long term, the project aims at laying the foundations for creating a pole of excellence on AM in Eastern Europe. For this reason, other two partners from low R&I performing countries, the University of Belgrade (Serbia) and the Institute of Physics of Materials, Academy of Sciences (Czech Republic) will also take part in this Twinning project.
To reach its goals, this 3-year project will be focussed on the implementation of knowledge transfer activities such as workshops and staff exchange,  training events (i.e. summer schools, seminars) for early stage researchers, and dissemination and communication actions (i.e. web site, videos, open access publications, public engagement activities) for different audiences.

The effort put into developing and implementing these policies is well documented in existing NEEAPs. Soon, emphasis will be put on finding out how effective they were to create new policies that allow meeting current and future energy savings targets. Unfortunately, several barriers limit policy evaluation. This results in a lack of quantitative data, and impedes evidence-based analysis required to distinguish effective from ineffective policies. 

EPATEE aims at tackling this problem by raising the capacity of policymakers and implementers to assist Members States to fulfil their obligation under energy related Directives. The project will provide them both with tools and with practical knowledge to make effective impact evaluation an integral part of the policy cycle. EPATEE makes use of existing evaluation experiences in a range of instruments, such as energy efficiency obligation schemes, regulations, financial incentives and voluntary agreements. Lessons learnt from other EU initiatives and good practices in how to successfully evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of such energy efficiency policies will provide the basis for the development of guidelines and good practice evaluation tools. A set of 20 to 30 tools enabling state-of-the-art evaluation will be developed and integrated into a smart online toolbox, which interactively assists users in picking the most relevant tool for their specific need.

The platform will foster uptake of ethical standards and responsible conduct of research, and ultimately support research excellence and strengthen society’s confidence in research and its findings.

This project has three unique features:

1. Stakeholder participation and community engagement
The first unique feature is the iterative, ‘bottom up’ approach, making explicit normative experiences of local stakeholders and principles embedded in local standards, rules and practices, and enabling a structuring of data that fits research and evaluation practice, providing useful, accessible information for local users.

2. Focus on (diversity of) RE\RI practices
The second unique feature is acknowledging the diversity of practices within and between countries and disciplines. Through normative analysis, differences wil be made explicit and open for comparison and deliberation. By using various methods of case analysis, prominent RE\RI cases from practice will be made accessible and scenarios will be developed. This will result in a structuring of data, based on their relevance for actual use by researchers.

3. Interactive self-sustainable Wiki-platform
The third unique feature is the development of an online platform that is dynamic, customer-tailored, up-to-date and self-sustainable. Based upon the MediaWiki approach, committed to open source and open data, the platform steers a user through its content based on what he seeks and what he needs to know.

Common mental health disorders account for an alarming proportion of the global burden of disease. Being regarded as an evidence-based psychotherapeutic eHealth intervention, Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT), has the potential to answer to this societal challenge by providing an efficacious and efficient treatment from which more people can benefit. As a result, various iCBT implementation projects are currently conducted across the world. We propose to use this natural laboratory to develop and evaluate a toolkit for tailored implementation strategies that is expected to make implementation trajectories more efficient.

The objectives for ImpleMentAll are:
1) To develop a generic Integrated Theory-based Framework for Intervention Tailoring Strategies (the ItFits-toolkit) for data-driven tailored implementation of evidence-based eHealth services.
2) To demonstrate the impact of the ItFits toolkit on the implementation of eHealth for common mental disorders, in 9 European countries, 2 LMIC, and Australia.
3) To disseminate the validated toolkit in various healthcare contexts across Europe.

ImpleMentAll is a true multidisciplinary international collaboration that unites key experts in clinical practice, health innovation, clinical research, and implementation science. Combined with it’s unique setup, ImpleMentAll will be able to test if tailoring implementation strategies lead to more efficient implementation. The resulting ItFits-toolkit will enable data driven evaluation of eHealth implementation projects in terms key performance indicators for process, effectiveness, and efficiency outcomes.

Such delay causes increased emissions and noise in the vicinity of the airport, as well as increasing the aircraft operator’s fuel costs. Greater congestion increases the air traffic control workload and can result in less efficient aircraft profiles.
To reduce airborne delays near the destination airport and the associated negative effects, two concepts can be used. One is to adjust an aircraft’s departure time by holding it on the ground so that its arrival time avoids the predicted peak in arriving traffic. Other methods involve trajectory extension or slowing down an aircraft in flight. This requires the arrival sequence to be calculated earlier than in current operations so that action can be taken early enough to have a meaningful effect.
The XSTREAM project will demonstrate the benefits gained through this latter concept. These methods can be used in combination with the former concept, traditionally regarded as a network management action, but refined through the use of arrival management tools. The project will demonstrate the use of arrival management techniques for pre-departure aircraft, the calculation, updating and passing of arrival management actions for airborne aircraft such as target time, time-to-lose/gain, or speed advisory from the destination arrival management system to upstream control units, and the impact of multiple arrival constraints within an Upper Airspace Control unit.
The operational demonstrations will be performed upon aircraft arriving at Paris CDG and Orly, London Heathrow and Gatwick, and Zurich. These optimized arrivals will be supported by several en-route Control units, which also will demonstrate how ‘multiple arrival constraints’ can be handled.

Why ? : Airport Operations Management in SESAR1 promoted enhanced situational awareness via the Airport Operations Plan (AOP) whilst reinforcing the collaborative decision making process through the Airport Operations Centre (APOC).  Validation activities stressed the need to further develop the Performance Monitoring and Management services promoting the evolution from a reactive (“firefighting”) approach toward one of pro-active collaborative decision making.

Impact : Includes the evolution toward a “performance-driven” airport through holistic monitoring of demand and capacity.  Decision making will be based on more reliable information with enhanced decision impact assessment.  Expected is an increase in the predictability, flexibility and efficiency of airport operations as well as increased resilience through shorter recovery to normal operations. 

Focus : PJ04  is articulated around two ‘SESAR Solutions’, emphasising  all of the key airport processes. Integration of airports into the ATM network will be addressed through sharing information in a timely manner between the Network Operations Plan and the individual AOPs using SWIM technology. 

Who ?: PJ04 unites key European aviation industry partners combining the right expertise to address these challenges and to drive deployment of  validated improvements.

Benefits : As clients of airport services, airlines will  benefit from enhanced operational efficiency. For passengers, benefits will be tangible. Information available will be of high quality and the more efficient use of airport resources will lead to enhanced service quality.

EU Strategic :  PJ04 will focus on  a range of different airport complexity levels developing scalable and cost-effective solutions, optimising both the local benefits and those for the European network. Societal concerns will be addressed by ensuring that environmental mitigation measures and impact are included in the airport performance 'trade off'.'",20803524.8,8802429.88,H2020-SESAR-2015-2,SESAR-RIA,AEROPORTS DE PARIS,FR,"AUSTRO CONTROL OSTERREICHISCHE GESELLSCHAFT FUR ZIVILLUFTFAHRT MBH;POLSKA AGENCJA ZEGLUGI POWIETRZNEJ;SAAB AKTIEBOLAG;HUNGAROCONTROL MAGYAR LEGIFORGALMISZOLGALAT ZARTKORUEN MUKODO RESZVENYTARSASAG;RIZENI LETOVEHO PROVOZU CESKE REPUBLIKY STATNI PODNIK;STICHTING NATIONAAL LUCHT- EN RUIMTEVAARTLABORATORIUM;FLUGHAFEN ZURICH AG;SWEDAVIA AB;STIFTELSEN SINTEF;ENAIRE;FLUGHAFEN MUNCHEN GMBH;VALSTYBES IMONE ORO NAVIGACIJA;EUROCONTROL - EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR THE SAFETY OF AIR NAVIGATION;ATOS BELGIUM;CROATIA CONTROL, CROATIAN AIR NAVIGATION SERVICES LTD;SINTEF AS;DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUER LUFT - UND RAUMFAHRT EV;AVINOR AS;FREQUENTIS AG;INDRA SISTEMAS SA;HEATHROW AIRPORT LIMITED;THALES LAS FRANCE SAS;LETOVE PREVADZKOVE SLUZBY SLOVENSKEJ REPUBLIKY, STATNY PODNIK;UDARAS EITLIOCHTA NA HEIREANN THE IRISH AVIATION AUTHORITY;LEONARDO - SOCIETA PER  AZIONI;NAVIAIR;LUFTFARTSVERKET;AIRTEL ATN LIMITED;SCHIPHOL NEDERLAND B.V.",AT;PL;SE;HU;CZ;NL;CH;NO;ES;DE;LT;BE;HR;UK;FR;SK;IE;IT;DK,NA

Free Routing (FR) implementation represents a step towards a less fragmented European airspace foreseen by Single European Sky (SES) and provides the AUs with the possibility to fly their user preferred routes in accordance with their business needs or mission requirements.  FR will result in a seamless airspace enabling more efficient flight, a reduction in AU costs and will promote cheaper travel, increasing personal mobility and trade. In addition, implementing Free Routing Airspace (FRA) will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that currently contribute to global warming, thereby creating a greener airspace.

FR was addressed within the SESAR 1 programme but additional R&D activities are required to support the implementation of FRA in high and very high complexity airspace (The EU Regulation No 716/2014 mandates FRA above FL 310 from 1 January 2022) and also to extend this implementation below FL310 thereby allowing other AUs to benefit (The European Air Traffic Management Master Plan version 2015 identifies the need for R&D work to support the management of performance-based Free Routing in lower airspace)

The partners in PJ06 will validate both the benefit to AUs and the impact on ATM of this extension of FRA into complex airspace and lower vertical limits through modelling and Real Time Simulations.  The results will seek to provide evidence that FRA can be implemented, cost effectively, in all the SES airspace.

This will be achieved by taking advantage of the latest technological developments from both an airborne and a ground-system perspective and through the secure sharing of data. The needs of all Airspace Users will be addressed including General Aviation and Rotorcraft.
 
All types of European TMA environments will be considered. For low to medium density/complexity TMAs the driver will be to exploit the environmental benefits achieved from Continuous Climb Operations, Continuous Descent Operations and improved arrival sequencing.  For the capacity-constrained high-density/complexity TMAs, particularly including multiple airports, the focus will be to minimise delays and improve resilience alongside providing environmental benefits. This will be achieved by enhancing arrival and departure management by the dynamic use of precision navigation routes.  Traffic flows will be optimised by improving the integration of the management of arrivals with departures and by improving the capability to balance traffic demand and available capacity across the network and airports.
 
To provide increased resilience in poor weather and a reduction in go-arounds, investigations will assess the use of tools that display traffic information in the cockpit. This will help manage airborne spacing, sequencing and merging with other aircraft, under the overall control of Air Traffic Control in systemised airspace.

This unique set of backgrounds and foreground can result in a significant step forward in horizontal integration and federation of IoT domains. Five use cases with real large scale deployments have been selected to validate our vision in representative smart spaces: home/residence, educational campus, stadium, mobility and yachting. Engagement with real users is key in our validation process.

CARISMAND is setting out to identify these factors, to explore existing gaps and opportunities for improvement of disaster policies and procedures, and to develop a comprehensive toolkit which will allow professional as well as voluntary disaster managers to adopt culturally-aware everyday practices. This goal will be achieved by approaching the links, and gaps, between disaster management, culture and risk perception from the broadest possible multi-disciplinary perspective and, simultaneously, developing a feedback-loop between disaster management stakeholders and citizens to establish, test, and refine proposed solutions for culturally-informed best practices in disaster management. Whilst experts from a variety of fields (in particular legal, IT, cognitive science, anthropology, psychology, sociology) will undertake a comprehensive collation of existing knowledge and structures, a number of Citizen Summits and Stakeholder Assemblies will be organised. Systematically, CARISMAND will use an approach that examines natural, man-made and technical disasters, placing at the centre of attention specific aspects that affect culturally informed risk perceptions, eg whether disasters are caused intentionally or not, the different “visibility” of hazards, and various time scales of disasters such as slow/fast onset and short- and long-term effects.

There are over 5 million people with autism in Europe – around 1 in every 100 people, affecting lives of over 20 million people each day. Alongside their difficulties, individuals with ASC tend to have intact and sometimes superior abilities to comprehend and manipulate closed, rule-based, predictable systems, such as robot-based technology.
 
Over the last couple of years, this has led to several attempts to teach emotion recognition and expression to individuals with ASC, using humanoid robots. This has been shown to be very effective as an integral part of the psychoeducational therapy for children with ASC. The main reason for this is that humanoid robots are perceived by children with autism as being more predictable, less complicated, less threatening, and more comfortable to communicate with than humans, with all their complex and frightening subtleties and nuances.
 
The proposed project aims to create and evaluate the effectiveness of such a robot-based technology, directed for children with ASC. This technology will enable to realise robust, context-sensitive (such as user- and culture-specific), multimodal (including facial, bodily, vocal and verbal cues) and naturalistic human-robot interaction (HRI) aimed at enhancing the social imagination skills of children with autism. The proposed will include the design of effective and user-adaptable robot behaviours for the target user group, leading to more personalised and effective therapies than previously realised.

The years 2010-2014 have seen a rapid upsurge of smartphone apps aimed at improving crime reporting and other forms of UGC and interaction associated with community policing. Yet these apps are characterised by a predominantly Anglo-Saxon approach with the largest number originating in the USA, a few in Canada, Australia and with the UK apparently the only major EU state where there has been some take-up of these technologies. CITYCoP sets out to find out why the EU appears to be lagging behind although Community Policing is nominally a policy which has been put into action in a number of EU countries. It then goes on to develop a solution including a new smartphone app and on-line portal which are capable of being deployed in any European city while still retaining “local flavour” and diversity. These ICT solutions will also be designed from scratch to be fully compliant with strict privacy and data protection laws. A training scheme, including use of serious games, will be developed to assist training of officers and citizens in use of the app and portal.  CITYCoP will benefit from a multi-disciplinary approach that will include the sociology of community policing as well as cognitive science perspectives of the citizen’s interaction with community and LEAs through technology.

APOLLO will use state-of-the-art methodologies for the calculation of agricultural parameters based on EO data, taking advantage of the improved spatial and temporal coverage of the new Sentinels. 
APOLLO will produce data on agricultural parameters through available EO, meteorological, and auxiliary data. Especially for the calculation of soil moisture, SAR images will be used for the first time with Sentinel-1, making it possible to obtain maps with a spatial and temporal resolution not achievable before. Based on the agricultural parameters calculated, a suite of farm management services (tillage scheduling, irrigation scheduling, crop growth monitoring, and crop yield estimation) will be developed, and will be delivered through a web and mobile interface. The service requirements will be elaborated in close collaboration with end users. 
APOLLO services will be cost-effective and affordable, thanks to access to free and open Copernicus data, an automated processing chain for the delivery of agricultural variables, independence from the need for ground-based sensors, and the pioneering use of Sentinel-1 data for estimating soil moisture information. 
The APOLLO platform and business case will be validated through pilot testing in Spain, Greece, and Serbia, with the participation of small farmers, agricultural consultants, farmers’ associations, and SMEs providing farm management services.
A business strategy for the take-up of APOLLO will be developed, assessing the operational sustainability of the platform based on market revenues.

The specific tasks that project sets out to undertake to achieve this are:
1) Data collection and identification of mechanisms;
2) Developing theoretical and econometric models in order to estimate the impact of the commitments;
3) Developing a conceptual model of the innovation system, leading to a reference tool on which the impact analysis of the commitments individually and as a whole will be based, and which will also play a role of interface between the assessments of the commitments impact and the macro sectoral econometric work.
4) A quantitative analysis of the commitments by use of the NEMESIS model, which is an existing macro-structural econometric model, but which will be modified and extended for the tasks at hand;

As Europe becomes more multicultural, and personal and professional mobility between cultures rapidly increases, access to fundamental resources such as local news and government services is limited by the great diversity of the EU's 37 languages.  The internet mostly developed in English, and without clear planning for how language issues might form barriers to access and engagement, nor how multilingualism might be supported.  In the EU, websites and online services for citizens have developed national local language resources, and often only provide a second language (usually English) when absolutely needed; but the great proliferation of web content, multiple and fast-changing content streams, and an expanding user interest base make this approach untenable. And while advanced natural language research and resources exist for a few dominant languages (English, French, German), many of Europe's smaller language communities---and the news media industry that serves them---lack appropriate tools for multilingual internet development.  For the EU to realise a truly equitable, open, multilingual future internet, new tools allowing high quality transformations (not translations) between languages are urgently needed.

About 70% of all adults experience NLBP at some point in their lives, and both conditions are among the top ten in terms of overall disease burden expressed as disability adjusted life years. Management of NLBP is a difficult challenge for healthcare professionals since their decisions have a decisive impact on the patient’s future health and welfare, as well as on the economic burden on the public and private healthcare systems. However, health professionals often lack appropriate information to tailor the management and follow-up of individual patients and to predict the outcome of a certain treatment. At European level, diverse research initiatives are undergoing at this moment for tackling NLBP from diverse angles, including biomarkers (PainOmics), pain self-management (selfBACK), lifestyle and workplace conditions (AHA), or patients stratification (STarT Back). Back-UP project provides a wider vision of NLBP, bringing together the research groups that are leading these and other innovative approaches to create a prognostic model to underpin more effective and efficient management of NLBP based on the digital representation of multidimensional clinical information and on simulations of the outcomes of possible interventions. Patient-specific models will provide a personalised evaluation of the patient case, using multidimensional health data from the following sources: personal, health, psychological, behavioural, and socioeconomic factors related to NLBP; biological patient characteristics, including musculoskeletal structures and function, and molecular data; and workplace and lifestyle risk factors.

We will use human biomonitoring to understand human exposure to chemicals and resulting health impacts and will communicate with policy makers to ensure that our results are exploited in the design of new chemicals policies and the evaluation of existing measures.
  
Key objectives include:
• Harmonizing procedures for human biomonitoring across 26 countries, to provide policy makers with comparable data on human internal exposure to chemicals and mixtures of chemicals at EU level; 
• Linking data on internal exposure to chemicals to aggregate external exposure and identifying exposure pathways and upstream sources. Information on exposure pathways is critical to the design of targeted policy measures to reduce exposure;
• Generating scientific evidence on the causal links between human exposure to chemicals and negative health outcomes; and
• Adapting chemical risk assessment methodologies to use human biomonitoring data and account for the contribution of multiple external exposure pathways to the total chemical body burden.
We will achieve these objectives by harmonizing human biomonitoring initiatives in 26 countries, drawing on existing expertise and building new capacities. By establishing National Hubs in each country to coordinate activities, we will create a robust Human Biomonitoring Platform at European level. 
This initiative contributes directly to the improvement of health and well-being for all age groups, by investigating how exposure to chemicals affects the health of different groups, such as children, pregnant women, foetuses and workers. We will also investigate how factor such as behavior, lifestyle and socio-economic status influence internal exposure to chemicals across the EU population.

The project is based on three agro-industries in the fodder (Spain), olive oil production (Greece) and cereal processing (Sweden) sectors that are willing to deploy new business lines in their facilities to open new markets in bio-commodities (energy, transport and manufacturing purposes) and intermediate bio-products (transport and biochemicals). These sectors represent over 10% turnover of agro-food industries and 30% of those with inherent synergies to integrate food and non-food business taking advantage of their existing equipment, seasonality and established food logistics. The synergies of applying IBLCs business in existing agro-industries can have a positive impact over 18% in final product price, giving a clear competitive strength to a wide segment of agro-industries, which can exploit this privileged situation compared to a new biomass supply business built from scratch.
The project is built on these agro-industries that will achieve a TRL7-8 in their facilities, guaranteeing operation under real conditions and with big amounts of production compared to the current activity, ensuring proximity to real market at the end of the project. Main challenges are based on being able to integrate logistics, harvesting and equipment in food and non-food applications, where the project is focused; ensuring marketability of the final bio-commodities. Besides, AGROinLOG will apply a multi-actor approach to attain experiences and knowledge of the sectors and agro-industries, enhancing the accuracy of the business models and developing effective and friendly guidelines of best practices to replicate and spread IBLC concept in Europe.

Europe has a major agricultural waste problem, generating some 700 million tonnes of waste annually. There is an urgent need and huge opportunity to address the efficient use of agricultural wastes, co-products and by-products (AWCB) towards delivering sustainable value chains in the farming and processing sectors. As such, AgroCycle will convert low value agricultural waste into highly valuable products, achieving a 10% increase in waste recycling and valorisation by 2020. This will be achieved by developing a detailed and holistic understanding of the waste streams and piloting a key number of waste utilisation/valorisation pathways. It will bring technologies and systems from ~TRL4 to ~TRL7 within the 3 years of the project. A post-project commercialisation plan will bring commercially promising technologies/systems to TRL8 and TRL9, ensuring AgroCycle will have an enduring impact by achieving sustainable use of AWCB both inside and outside the agricultural sector, leading to the realisation of a Circular Economy. 

AgroCycle addresses wastes from several agricultural sectors: wine, olive oil, horticulture, fruit, grassland, swine, dairy and poultry. The AgroCycle consortium is a large (25) multi-national group (including China) comprising the necessary and relevant multi-actors (i.e. researchers; companies in the technical, manufacturing, advisory, retail sectors (Large and SMEs); lead users; end users; and trade/producer associations) for achieving the project’s ambitions goals.

Thus, major advancements have to be made in this sector to reach the EU’s climate and energy targets. Energy-efficient buildings will also contribute to the vision of secure, affordable and climate-friendly energy for citizens and businesses as well as generating additional societal, environmental and economic benefits.

To strengthen policies that promote retrofitting and modernizing existing buildings, the EU has adopted the Directive 2012/27/EU on Energy Efficiency (EED). It requires EU Member States and candidate countries to establish a long-term strategy for mobilizing investment in the renovation of the national building by 30 April 2014, and every 3 years thereafter. These action plans are an integral part of a country’s National Energy Efficiency Action Plans. As of May 2015, 27 EU Member States have adhered to the requirement of Article 4, EED, and submitted their national building renovation strategy, albeit most did not meet the April deadline and some submitted their strategies as late as March 2015.
However, the requirements to prepare these renovation strategies appear to have overburdened most EU member states. According to an analysis conducted by the Buildings Performance Institute Europe, only five countries have at least adequately complied with the five core elements described in Article 4 of the EED. To date, no renovation strategy has been submitted that can count as a ‘best practice’ and provide orientation for other countries.

First, we will study how different LLL policies are compatible with each other in terms of their orientations and objectives and how each policy considers the needs of ‘young adults’. Second, we will research the intended and unintended effects of policies on young adults. In this regard, we will look into relevant social developments such as life course de-standardisation processes and into an emerging new political economy of skills. Third, we will generate new knowledge about regional and local policymaking, with particular attention to actors, dynamics, and trends. By focusing on their regional/local context, we will elucidate the interaction and complementarity of LLL policies with other sectors of society, thus contributing to a better understanding of current fragmentation and discrepancies, in order to set parameters for future decision-making support systems. 
The project will first contribute new knowledge of the impact of LLL policies on young adults’ life courses, yielding insights on the conditions, strategies, and necessities for policies to become effective. In addition, it will provide insights on the innovations and potentials they unlock, in particular with view to informal and non-formal learning to better address vulnerable groups.

But it has a problem: Most EU citizens don’t care about some Brussels agency they never heard of. The solution is in the ERC’s mandate: frontier research. It has science – the cutting edge variety, that can capture the imagination, change the world and stimulate curiosity. We have seen the power of a fundamental science story elsewhere, and how it can focus attention on the institution behind it: the Higgs boson and CERN.  It takes high scientific achievement, great story-telling, a tight focus, creative communications and a sustained effort to build a mass following in science. We believe the ERC can achieve this – to matter as the source of cool science, to students, investors, policy makers, researchers, and all citizens generally, in all 28 EU member-states and beyond. The ERC can invent science and mirror it back to society. In short, ERC = ScienceSquared.

To convey this message, the ERC = ScienceSquared campaign will promote ERC projects and grantees through a cluster of innovative, popular and high quality content packages – punchy videos, long-form ‘snowfall’ articles, tiny Tweets, augmented reality, ‘pop-up’  displays – which will be adapted to a new research theme every six months. The content packages will be used in ten science museums, 34 universities, hundreds of online media channels and many other outlets covering 37 countries. These will be sustainable communication channels, which the ERC can continue using when the contract is over, targeting key audience segments: more than 40 million people. This campaign – as ‘cool’ as the ERC itself - will stir interest in science, raise awareness of the ERC as a science power, build broader political and societal support for the ERC – and encourage grant applications from a new generation of researchers, especially in countries under-represented among ERC grantees.",958759,958759,ERC-2014-SUPPORT-1,CSA,SCIENCE BUSINESS PUBLISHING LIMITED,UK,"CROWDHELIX LIMITED;EVRO-SREDOZEMSKA UNIVERZA;EIRMA EUROPE AISBL;SVEUCILISTE U ZAGREBU MEDICINSKI FAKULTET;CIENCIA VIVA-AGENCIA NACIONAL PARA A CULTURA CIENTIFICA E TECNOLOGICA;ASSOCIATION EUROPEENNE DES EXPOSITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES TECHNIQUES ET INDUSTRIELLES;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK -  NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, CORK",UK;SI;BE;HR;PT;IE,NA

Current therapies, including innovative autologous cell-based treatments, cannot predictably and reproducibly restore cartilage structure and function. 
BIOCHIP will carry out a multicenter, prospective phase II clinical trial to treat knee cartilage injuries using engineered grafts based on autologous nasal chondrocytes (NC). As compared to typically employed articular chondrocytes, NC have a higher and more reproducible capacity to generate mature cartilage tissues. Importantly, molecular/mechanical characterization, large size animal studies and a phase I trial carried out by BIOCHIP partners have already shown the compatibility of NC upon implantation in a joint, with promising preliminary clinical results.
BIO-CHIP’s specific objectives are:
(1) To test the hypothesis that the maturation of NC-based cartilage grafts improves the clinical efficacy in the treatment of cartilage lesions (108 patients will be recruited to reach statistical significance)
(2) To extend the range of clinical indications of NC-based grafts to so far untreatable pre-osteoarthritic lesions (‘kissing’ cartilage lesions in a sheep model)
BIO-CHIP capitalizes on clinical experience of 4 reference centers for cartilage surgery, on established GMP manufacturing capacity and on preparation for commercial exploitation by a strong orthopedic device company. Demonstration of therapeutic efficacy of the new treatment will address a large clinical need (over 2 million cartilage defects/year worldwide), improve quality of life (reduce pain & disability in the young, delay prosthetic implants in the elderly), exploit a commercial opportunity (prospected revenues of up to 130 million €/year) and reduce healthcare costs (estimated 12,000€ healthcare savings/procedure).

These new smarter objects will dynamically change their status in response to a variety of factors and be seamlessly tracked during their lifecycle. This will change the way users-to-things interactions are viewed.

Combining the power of functional inks with the pervasiveness of digital (e.g. QR-codes) and electronic (e.g. NFC tags) markers, zillions of objects will embed cheap sensing capabilities thus being able to capture new contextual information. Beside this, the ubiquitous presence of smartphones with their cameras and NFC readers will create the perfect bridge between everyday users and their objects. This will create a completely new flow of crowdsourced information, which extracted from the objects and enriched with user data, can be exploited by new services. 

TagItSmart will create an open, interoperable cloud-based platform with all the tools and enabling technologies, which will address the challenges related to the lifecycle management of new innovative services capitalizing on objects “sensorization”. TagItSmart will empower all steps involved from creating smart markers, Functional Codes (FCs), to supporting secure and reliable acquisition and consumption of such contextual data, while preserving user privacy, to the provision of generic functionalities and a service composition platform which will allow even inexperienced users to create and deploy their FCs based services while maintaining system efficiency.

To boost the platform adoption, a set of industrial use cases will be used as a baseline for development, while additional stakeholders will be engaged through a co-creation Open Call approach.

Primary production—that is agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture—forms the foundation of the food system. Its structure and performance is influenced by various conditions shaped by both the public and the private sector. As economic agents, primary producers aim at generating a sufficient amount of income, but their financial conditions are highly dependent on public and private actors, such as government regulators (including the EU’s agricultural and fisheries policies), the financial sector, suppliers, the food industry, retailers, etc. In other words, the web of policy requirements as well as input and output market imperfections greatly shape farmers’ and fishermen’s livelihoods. Knowledge on the conditions of primary producers and the driving forces influencing these conditions exists, but in a fragmented way: not all primary producers and regions are covered, not all driving forces have been investigated, cross-linkages between them have been insufficiently analysed, future opportunities are not well integrated, etc. The purpose of SUFISA is to identify sustainable practices and policies in the agricultural, fish and food sectors that support the sustainability of primary producers in a context of multi-dimensionsal policy requirements, market uncertainties and globalisation.",4863662.5,4863661.75,H2020-SFS-2014-2,RIA,KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN,BE,"UNIVERSITEIT HASSELT;AARHUS UNIVERSITET;FONDATION INSTITUT DE RECHERCHE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT DURABLE ET LES RELATIONS INTERNATIONALES;UNIVERSIDADE DE EVORA;UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE;EKONOMSKI FAKULTET, UNIVERZITET U BEOGRADU;UNIVERSITA DI PISA;NODIBINAJUMS BALTIC STUDIES CENTRE;SYDDANSK UNIVERSITET;AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS;ALMA MATER STUDIORUM - UNIVERSITA DI BOLOGNA;HOCHSCHULE FUR NACHHALTIGE ENTWICKLUNG EBERSWALDE;UNIWERSYTET JAGIELLONSKI",BE;DK;FR;PT;UK;RS;IT;LV;EL;DE;PL,NA

The HERA Joint Research Programme Uses of the Past (HERA JRP UP) consortium will establish a 3rd joint transnational programme for multi-disciplinary research into a topic at the heart of the reflective society: ”Uses of the Past”. The innovative projects funded will fundamentally link past(s), present and future(s) creating valuable new knowledge that gives insights into the forces shaping the social, cultural and political transformation in Europe today. 
The HERA JRP UP will also pursue additional activities aiming at international capacity-building in humanities research, promoting embedding of humanities researchers in Horizon 2020, and will explore and prepare new joint actions.

Twenty-four organisations from 23 countries have pooled a substantial amount of their humanities research funding (21 M EUR) for this HERA JRP, thus increasing the efficiency and impact of public funding. The HERA JRP UP involves the launch of a joint Call for Proposals and a commonly-agreed two-stage evaluation process involving an independent, international Review Panel. The consortium expects to fund 21 transnational humanities centred projects of ~1.2 M EUR each. EC support is awarded to the level of 33% of the joint call budget. The HERA JRP UP consortium will actively support knowledge exchange activities and stimulate wider dissemination about the valuable contributions of new humanities research. 

With this large transnational JRP and its associated activities the HERA JRP UP will mobilise the intellectual energies and collaborative potential of a wide range of humanities disciplines, and further develop the knowledge base of the European Research Area by sharing and debating interpretations of the human past and its relation to the present and future. While this proposal is for the delivery of the “Uses of the Past” programme, the wider vision of a collaborative, multi-disciplinary and impact-rich humanities sector across Europe is at the forefront of our collective endeavour.",20572084,5000000,H2020-REFLECTIVE-SOCIETY-2014,ERA-NET-Cofund,NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR WETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK,NL,"HRVATSKA AKADEMIJA ZNANOSTI I UMJETNOSTI;STYRELSEN FOR FORSKNING OG UDDANNELSE;FONDS ZUR FÖRDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN FORSCHUNG;SIHTASUTUS EESTI TEADUSAGENTUUR;THE ICELANDIC CENTRE FOR RESEARCH;Lietuvos mokslo taryba;VETENSKAPSRADET - SWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL;AKADEMIE VED CESKE REPUBLIKY;VALSTS IZGLITIBAS ATTISTIBAS AGENTURA;MINISTERIO DE ECONOMIA Y COMPETITIVIDAD;SUOMEN AKATEMIA;THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL;DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUER LUFT - UND RAUMFAHRT EV;NARODOWE CENTRUM NAUKI;UNITED KINGDOM RESEARCH AND INNOVATION;CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE;NORGES FORSKNINGSRAD;SCHWEIZERISCHER NATIONALFONDS ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN FORSCHUNG;AN TUDARAS UM ARD OIDEACHAS;FONDS NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE;AGENCE NATIONALE DE LA RECHERCHE;Ministrstvo za izobrazevanje, znanost in sport;FONDS VOOR WETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK-VLAANDEREN;FEDERAAL FONDS VOOR WETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK;FUNDACAO PARA A CIENCIA E A TECNOLOGIA",HR;DK;AT;EE;IS;LT;SE;CZ;LV;ES;FI;UK;DE;PL;IT;NO;CH;IE;LU;FR;SI;BE;PT,NA

The project’s name – EU IDEA – Integration and Differentiation for Effectiveness and Accountability – captures these key questions. The basic claim underpinning our proposal is that differentiation is not only necessary to address current challenges more effectively, by making the Union more resilient and responsive to citizens. Differentiation is also desirable, by introducing a useful degree of flexibility in the complex EU machinery, so long as such flexibility is compatible with the core principles of the EU’s constitutionalism and identity, sustainable in terms of governance, and acceptable to EU citizens, Member States and affected third partners. In line with these premises and objectives, EU IDEA will conduct an historical and philosophical investigation of the origins of differentiation, within and outside the EU (WP 1); analyse differentiation – in relation to issues of governance and accountability (WP 2) and narratives on EU constitutionalism and identity (WP 3); investigate the practice of differentiation in key policy areas (WPs 4-5-6) and in light of the prospects for Brexit (WP 7); and assess the political and public preferences at national level (WP 8). The findings of our analysis will be instrumental to defining the criteria – at institutional, policy and societal levels – to assess future scenarios of differentiation as a tool of integration (or disintegration) and to develop policy recommendations for EU and national policy-makers with an aim to a more effective and accountable Union (WP 9).",2991471.25,2991471.25,H2020-SC6-GOVERNANCE-2018,RIA,ISTITUTO AFFARI INTERNAZIONALI,IT,EGMONT - INSTITUT ROYAL DES RELATIONS INTERNATIONALES;INSTITUT ZA DEMOKRATIJA SOCIETAS CIVILIS SKOPJE;EUROPEAN NEWS SERVICE SRL;UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE;SABANCI UNIVERSITESI;INSTITUT FUR EUROPAISCHE POLITIK EV;CENTRE FOR EUROPEAN REFORM;NORSK UTENRIKSPOLITISK INSTITUTT;NOTRE EUROPE - INSTITUT JACQUES DELORS;Finnish Institute of International Affairs;RIJKSUNIVERSITEIT GRONINGEN;CENTRE FOR INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION IN BARCELONA;EUROPEAN POLICY CENTRE;USTAV MEZINARODNICH VZTAHU V.V.I.,BE;MK;IT;CH;TR;DE;UK;NO;FR;FI;NL;ES;CZ,NA

Present issues and past experiences of technological revolutions,2019-03-01,2023-02-28,NA,"We are witnessing the emergence of what is in very important ways essentially a new religion. Digitisation and globalisation have influenced not only social and political practices and organisation, but also religious beliefs and practices. Islam, the Islamic commonwealth and the Muslims, are at the forefront of the most recent developments. Hitherto relatively marginal theological and ideological trends have acquired new prominence within Islam and this new Islam is being disseminated as a brand in an ever-expanding corpus of public images and imaginaries. This newly acquired hyper-visibility is reminiscent of the impact of the printing press on the Catholic church in the 16th century, and its role in the Reform movement. The impact today of technological innovations on the development of Islam requires urgent assessment.
The MIDA proposal aims to understand how digitisation is shaping Islam (i.e. beliefs, practices, political and social institutions, and outlooks). How is this technological revolution modifying the relation Muslims have with the past? Why is it reshaping Islam in more profound ways than other monotheisms? We need to understand the developments that are transforming religious belief in our time and to do so scholarship itself needs to seize the resources of the technological revolution that is spurring change.  
The MIDA project will make possible the necessary training of a group of young researchers, able to answer collectively to the challenge, providing them inter-sectoral, interdisciplinary, international skills.
To tackle the complexity of the issue, five interlocking work packages have been designed, each including comparative work on historical case-studies: ‘Narratives of the Self’; ‘Languages and Translation’; ‘Images and Materiality in Islam’; ‘Contested Authority and Knowledge Production’ and ‘Mobility and Mobilisation beyond Borders’.",3874112.28,3874112.28,H2020-MSCA-ITN-2018,MSCA-ITN-ETN,CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS,FR,PHILIPPS UNIVERSITAET MARBURG;UNIVERSITEIT LEIDEN;STICHTING VU;STICHTING KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT;AGENCIA ESTATAL CONSEJO SUPERIOR DEINVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS;GIGA GERMAN INSTITUTE OF GLOBAL ANDAREA STUDIES STIFTUNG;FONDACIJA KULTURNO NASLIJEDE BEZ GRANICA;INSTITUT DE RECHERCHE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT;KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN;FREIE UNIVERSITAET BERLIN;UNIVERSITEIT VAN AMSTERDAM,DE;NL;ES;BA;FR;BE,NA

The need for such an infrastructure has clearly emerged out of the lexicographic community within the European Network of e-Lexicography COST Action which will end in 2017.

Current lexicographic resources, both modern and historical, have different levels of structuring and are not equally suitable for application in other fields, e.g. Natural Language Processing. The project will develop strategies, tools and standards for extracting, structuring and linking lexicographic resources to unlock their full potential for Linked Open Data and the Semantic Web, as well as in the context of digital humanities.

The project will help researchers create, access, share, link, analyse, and interpret heterogeneous lexicographic data across national borders, paving the way for ambitious, transnational, data-driven advancements in the field, while significantly reducing a duplication of effort across disciplinary boundaries.

ELEXIS will be carried out by a balanced consortium with distributed geographical origins.

It intends to systematise and bring knowledge to practitioners, promote collaboration within a demand-driven innovation logic and provide inputs to policymaking through links to the EIP-AGRI. SKIN will build and animate a community of about 500 stakeholders, with the strategic objective of setting up, at the conclusion of the project, a European association permanently working for the improvement of SFSCs efficiency and for the benefit of stakeholders and growth in the sector. The community will be built and animated around the identification of good practices in short supply chains across Europe. Partners will scout, analyse and classify a significant number of cases in different countries. “Best practices” (at least 100) will be systematised, processed into highly usable formats (including video and page-flows) and made accessible to stakeholders via the web (following the EIP AGRI formats) and through the set-up of regional nodes, to allow a deeper penetration of existing knowledge into practice. The work on good practices will also allow identifying key issues (hindrances or opportunities) around SFSCs. Such issues will be the main themes of 6 “innovation challenges workshops” the purpose of which is to stimulate stakeholders to propose new ideas for innovation based research or innovation uptake. These will be supported in a coaching phase where consortium partners deliver guidance to stakeholders for the full development of those innovative ideas.
SKIN puts significant efforts in dissemination, to reach as many stakeholders as possible, and exploitation, to plan post projects developments in the form of a permanent association that would give continuity to the activities launched with the project (community expansion, circulation of good practices, promotion of research based innovation and linkages with the EIP and policy making instances).",2191975,1999718.75,H2020-RUR-2016-1,CSA,UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI FOGGIA,IT,"CASSOVIA LIFE SCIENCES;YOURIS.COM;ASSOCIATION DE COORDINATION TECHNIQUE POUR L'INDUSTRIE AGROALIMENTAIRE;EUROPE FOR BUSINESS LTD;UNIVERSITEIT GENT;Campden BRI Magyarorszag Nonprofit Korlatolt Felelossegu Tarsasag;CONFEDERAZIONE GENERALE DELL AGRICOLTURA ITALIANA;WIRELESSINFO;ZUIDELIJKE LAND- EN TUINBOUWORGANISATIE VERENIGING;COOPERATIVAS AGRO-ALIMENTARIAS DE ESPANA U DE COOP SOCIEDAD COOPERATIVA;UZHGORODSKYI NACIONALNYI UNIVERSITET;VEREIN ZUR FORDERUNG VON REGIONAL- UND AGRARPROJEKTEN;TEAGASC - AGRICULTURE AND FOOD DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY;BOERENBONDVERENIGING VOOR INNOVATIEVE PROJECTEN VZW;SEGES PS;TINADA SRL;MAGYAR TUDOMANYOS AKADEMIA KOZGAZDASAG- ES REGIONALIS TUDOMANYI KUTATOKOZPONT;BIOSENSE INSTITUTE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN BIOSYSTEMS;LANDBRUG & FODEVARER F.M.B.A.;COLLISON AND ASSOCIATES LIMITED;EUROPEAN QUALIFICATION ALLIANCE SP ZOO;CREHAN, KUSANO & ASSOCIATES",SK;BE;FR;UK;HU;IT;CZ;NL;ES;UA;AT;IE;DK;RS;PL,NA

The proposed inter/multidisciplinary research and exchange project’s title refers to that fact. Knowledge and science exchange between Europe and the BSR intensified in the course of the 19th and early 20th century and was interrupted when as result of WWI/WWII a significant part of the BSR was integrated into the Soviet Union’s orbit. The BSR disappeared behind the Iron Curtain and the academic cultures of West and East drifted apart. The previous 25 years have witnessed strengthening ties between BSR countries and between the BSR and the rest of Europe as well as globalisation of knowledge and scientific exchange. The integration of the BSR into the European Research Area (ERA) is on the way but not yet completed. The proposed project provides excellent opportunities to critically reflect the sketched processes and to look into future.
The suggested project’s quality, credibility and novelty lies in its
* attempt to systematically investigate knowledge and cultural exchanges between the BSR and Western Europe from the late 18th century to the present,
* theoretical and methodological approaches with the potential to establish new pathways for future research and in its 
 foregrounding of gender aspects.
The suggested project establishes a network consisting of 12 research institutions from 12 BSR countries and Austria. It includes representatives of all the core disciplines of the humanities emerging around 1900.
Innovative aspects of the proposed project consist of 1) drawing attention to an emerging region (BSR) consisting of countries previously considered as belonging to separate historical regions, 2) systematic investigation of knowledge and culture exchange within and beyond the region, 3) innovative theoretical framework, 4) inter/multidisciplinary methodology and 5) explicit gender perspectives.",1665000,1665000,H2020-MSCA-RISE-2016,MSCA-RISE,UNIVERSITAET GRAZ,AT,UNIVERSITATEA DE STAT DIN MOLDOVA;INSTITUTUL DE ISTORIE NICOLAE IORGA;DIETHNES PANEPISTIMIO ELLADOS;ODESSA NATIONAL I.I.

Innovative approaches to turn agricultural waste into ecological and economic assets.
Driven by a “near zero-waste” society requirement, the goal of NoAW project is to generate innovative efficient approaches to convert growing agricultural waste issues into eco-efficient bio-based products opportunities with direct benefits for both environment, economy and EU consumer. To achieve this goal, the NoAW concept relies on developing holistic life cycle thinking able to support environmentally responsible R&D innovations on agro-waste conversion at different TRLs, in the light of regional and seasonal specificities, not forgetting risks emerging from circular management of agro-wastes (e.g. contaminants accumulation).
By involving all agriculture chain stakeholders in a territorial perspective, the project will:
(1) develop innovative eco-design and hybrid assessment tools of circular agro-waste management strategies and address related gap of knowledge and data via extensive exchange through the Knowledge exchange Stakeholders Platform, 
(2) develop breakthrough knowledge on agro-waste molecular complexity and heterogeneity in order to upgrade the most widespread mature conversion technology (anaerobic digestion) and to synergistically eco-design robust cascading processes to fully convert agro-waste into a set of high added value bio-energy, bio-fertilizers and bio-chemicals and building blocks, able to substitute a significant range of non-renewable equivalents, with favourable air, water and soil impacts
and (3) get insights of the complexity of potentially new, cross-sectors, business clusters in order to fast track NoAW strategies toward the field and develop new business concepts and stakeholders platform for cross-chain valorisation of agro-waste on a territorial and seasonal basis.",7816232.5,6887570,H2020-WASTE-2015-two-stage,RIA,INSTITUT NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE AGRONOMIQUE,FR,"INSTITUTE OF AGRO-PRODUCTS PROCESSING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES;INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE INCORPORATED;SOFIES SA;NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS - NTUA;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;NINGBO TIANAN BIOLOGIC MATERIAL CO.

MyToolBox will not only pursue a field-to-fork approach but will also consider safe use options of contaminated batches, such as the efficient production of biofuels. A major component of MyToolBox, which also distinguishes this proposal from previous efforts in the area mycotoxin reduction, is to provide the recommended measures to the end users along the food and feed chain in a web-based Toolbox. Cutting edge research will result in new interventions, which will be integrated together with existing measures in the Toolbox that will guide the end user as to the most effective measure(s) to be taken to reduce crop losses. We will focus on small grain cereals, maize, peanuts and dried figs, applicable to agricultural conditions in EU and China. Crop losses using existing practices will be compared with crop losses after novel pre-harvest interventions including investigation of genetic resistance to fungal infection, cultural control, the use of novel biopesticides (organic-farming compliant), competitive biocontrol treatment and development of forecasting models to predict mycotoxin contamination. Research into post-harvest measures including real-time monitoring during storage, innovative sorting of crops using vision-technology and novel milling technology will enable cereals with higher mycotoxin levels to be processed without breaching regulatory limits in finished products.

Our 30-partner consortium representing 11 EU and 4 non-EU countries combines leading academic, communication, SME and stakeholder organisations to ensure a multi-actor approach. It will undertake case study-based quantitative research to measure economic, environmental and social impacts of FQS, PSFP and SFSC. The impact of PSFP policies on balanced nutrition in schools will also be assessed. Primary research will be complemented by advanced econometric analysis of existing datasets to determine impacts of FQS and SFSC participation on farm performance and survival, as well as understand price transmission and trade patterns. Consumer knowledge, confidence in, valuation and use of FQS labels and products will be assessed via cross-national survey, ethnographic and virtual supermarket-based research. Lessons from the research will be applied and verified in 6 pilot initiatives, focusing on less-developed and transition regions. These initiatives bring together academic and non-academic stakeholder partners in action research. The six pilot actions are: a school meals initiative to improve the nutritional outcomes and economic benefits for local agri-food producers; in-store trials (undertaken with a grocery retailer) to upscale sales of local produce; a scheme to stimulate a sustainable SFSC that adds value to the fishing community; and pilot actions to expand regional food labelling; increase sales of FQS products in non-traditional markers; and improve returns to local producers at food fairs and farmers’ markets (via a smartphone app).

Commonfare is a new collaborative form of welfare provision based on equitable governance and grassroots democracy. It entails the involvement of diverse stakeholders to facilitate the bottom-up arousal of collective practices tackling the needs of the new poor (precarious workers, working poor, NEETs, people left behind by safety nets). The consortium will achieve this goal through a Collective Awareness Platform (CAPS) which (a) informs people about existing welfare state provisions, (b) provides them with the means to share good practices on how to handle poverty-related issues, and (c) supports their abilities to network and to sustain real-life value. 
The project pioneers commonfare as a new social innovation goal by raising collective awareness on the threats connected to Poverty, lack of Income, and unEmployment (‘PIE conditions’), thus empowering the new poor and enabling the relevant stakeholders, e.g. polivcy makers, to tackle such threats more effectively. Three pilot actions (in Croatia, Italy, and the Netherlands) will drive the design and implementation of the PIE News project, triggering a public engagement process. PIE NEWS capitalizes on the collective power and skills of the ‘new poor’ promoting commonfare through actions that increase collective awareness on PIE Conditions. Such actions will be supported by an extensive dissemination strategy, including, e. g., open calls for the organization of bottom-up networking events. 
The PIE News platform will innovate the CAPS domain not only in terms of target population and, public design approach, but also by combining a reputation system as a way to remunerate labour with a digital currency as a mean of acquisition of good and services within and outside the platform.",1994667,1994667,H2020-ICT-2015,RIA,UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI TRENTO,IT,CREATE-NET (CENTER FOR RESEARCH AND TELECOMMUNICATION EXPERIMENTATION FOR NETWORKED COMMUNITIES);THE UNIVERSITY COURT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ABERTAY DUNDEE;MITI - MADEIRA INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES INSTITUTE - ASSOCIACAO;ASSOCIAZIONE BASIC INCOME NETWORK ITALIA;STICHTING DYNE.

With the internationalization of distribution chains, the key for success lies within efficient logistics. In such facilities, goods for the end-user or products in the B2B sector are stored, commissioned and shipped. To manage the supply chains, many new warehouses have been erected and more will follow. With the growing markets, the need for larger warehouses and their automation increases. To advance the position of the European trade sector, technical restrictions on the size of warehouses should be avoided and new automation paradigm should be implemented to ensure their efficient operation. Therefore the European robotic and automation companies should be able to provide appropriate solutions, making scalable systems and scalable software mandatory. Current automation solutions based on strict separation of humans and robots cannot provide such efficient operation of large warehouses. SafeLog aims to overcome this issue by enabling much more efficient warehouse concepts joining human and robot workforce. Given that, the overall objective of SafeLog is the conception and implementation of a large-scale flexible warehouse system which enables safe and efficient collaboration of humans and robots in the same area and at the same time.

On the way to reach this objective SaveLog will develop, integrate and test: (1) a holistic and certifiable safety concept based on the safety vest, which allows the collaboration of robots and humans in a flexible warehouse system, (2) planning and scheduling algorithms for a heterogeneous fleet manager, which allow the adhoc reactive planning and scheduling for human and robot workforce in a flexible warehouse system, and (3) augmented reality based interaction strategies to support workers in a robotized warehouse system with information about their current task and environment.",4618462.5,4618462.5,H2020-ICT-2015,RIA,KARLSRUHER INSTITUT FUER TECHNOLOGIE,DE,FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;KONCAR INSTITUT ZA ELEKTROTEHNIKU D.D.;SVEUCILISTE U ZAGREBU FAKULTET ELEKTROTEHNIKE I RACUNARSTVA;SWISSLOG AUTOMATION GMBH;CESKE VYSOKE UCENI TECHNICKE V PRAZE,DE;HR;CZ,NA

Now, the same is happening to manufacturing as tangible objects are created and designed as virtual ‘bits’ which can be shared globally, but then reproduced as things which manifest themselves locally. This is the maker movement.

MAKE-IT will study maker communities, both through ten different case studies and innovation action research, to enhance their use of Collective Awareness Platforms (CAPs). CAPs support maker communities and networks to innovate, design and make physical products based on peer collaboration and sharing. MAKE-IT, in which key maker platforms, technology firms and citizen communities participate, will focus on three perspectives: organisation and governance of the communities, their peer and collaborative activities and behaviour, and their economic and societal value and impact. Together, the findings will inform recommendations for the maker movement itself, and its implementation through CAPs, and be made assessable to many other CAPs uses, in areas like health, education and transport. MAKE-IT will also offer strategic advice for industry and give recommendations for national-level and European policy makers.

A better understanding of how CAPs are central to the maker movement will enable more sustainable production and consumption patterns by generating awareness and by leveraging peer pressure for better lifestyles through behavioural and system change. It will also contribute directly to constructing a more circular economy by stimulating resource efficiency, re-using materials and energy, and re-designing production processes to move towards zero waste.

Yet, the calculation and modeling to do this is difficult and time consuming, especially for SMEs without a large overhead of trained staff and tools, due to difficulties in integrating data between incompatible tools and formats for different design stages: conceptual hull design; the finite element calculations feeding preliminary and detailed designs; and virtual prototyping simulation models.  This is coupled with the lack of an industry specific lifecycle modeling technique, hindered by the lack of information to support reliable decision-making.
SHIPLYS aims to transfer experience from the development of industry modeling coherence schemes e.g. BIM (Building Information Modelling), and use them to produce new techniques for quick, reliable multi-disciplinary modeling capability for the marine industry:
- Develop standardization aspects of the new paradigm by transferring the key BIM Product Model principles: identify and capture the useful implicit information in existing CAD/CAE data and develop data formats to provide persistence for data reuse between design stages
- Develop a Virtual Prototyping system to incorporate LCCA, environmental and risk assessment  criteria, for fast and cost effective evaluation of alternatives

RECAP proposes a methodology for improving the efficiency and transparency of the compliance monitoring procedure through a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) platform which will make use of large volumes of publicly available data provided by satellite remote sensing, and user-generated data provided by farmers through mobile devices (geo-referenced and time-stamped photos).
The RECAP platform will extract useful features from Earth Observation open data, correlate them with user-generated and geo-information data available to public organisations, and model this information for enabling the identification of potential breaches of compliance by public authorities and inspectors. 
RECAP will offer farmers a tool supporting them to comply with regulations imposed by the CAP, providing personalised information for simplifying the interpretation of complex regulations, and early alerts on potential breaches.
RECAP will allow agricultural consultants and developers to create add-ons to the main application that extend its functionality and exploit the data collected through an Application Programming Interface (API), and a Software Development Kit (SDK). Consultants will be able to access data available in the platform, subject to security and privacy policies, and to develop their own services within the platform using design tools, libraries, and communication with the database under an open approach.

Thanks to a prototype aggregation solution and renewable generation forecasting techniques, flexibility providers – distributed generators (DG) and Commercial and Industrial (C&I) consumers providing demand response (DR) – are enabled, through retailers acting as flexibility aggregators, to provide competitive offers for Frequency Restoration Reserve (including secondary control activated with a response time between 30 seconds and 15 minutes). A comprehensive techno-economic model for the cross-border integration of such services involves a common activation function (CAF) tailored to congested borders and optimized to overcome critical intra-regional barriers. The resulting CAF is implemented into a prototype Regional Balancing and Redispatching Platform, securely integrated within the four TSOs’ IT systems: this makes research activities about cross-border integration flexible while linking with the aggregation solution. Use cases of growing complexity are pilot tested, going from the involvement of DR and DG into national balancing markets to cross-border competition between flexibility aggregators. Based on past experience with tertiary reserve, participating C&I consumers and DG are expected to provide close to 40MW of secondary reserve.

However, in the past few years building acoustics has been influenced by evolution issues in terms of new acoustics requirements focused on sound insulation at low frequencies (reflected in proposals in the ISO 140 family), and by improving the single-number quantities (ISO 717) which would correlate better with subjective perception of sounds transmitted through building structures.
The proposed project aims at (1) improving the diagnostic methods for more precise determination of physical properties of building elements (ISO140), (2) involving subjective assessment of sound insulation to help propose a suitable single number quantity (ISO 717), and (3) enabling sustainable product innovation as the result of improved diagnostic methods.
First and foremost, novel acoustic measuring techniques, specifically, Laser Scanning Vibrometry and acoustic cameras, will be applied for developing novel diagnostic procedures. Second, noise perception tests will be developed using advanced, full 3D sound field recreation techniques. Single number quantities will be proposed to reflect perceived annoyance by noise, with the extension to low-frequency range <100 Hz. Finally, these advancements will be used for innovative design of building elements with improved sound insulation.
This will have a lasting impact on collaborating partners of the consortium, both on universities, whose task will be to implement the research findings in practical solutions connected to noise abatement for raising living comfort, and SMEs, who will gain knowledge for innovation in design of sound insulating building elements and learn new methods for a precise detection of sound insulation deficiencies

Because of limitations in current NAFLD treatment therapies, many new efforts focus on exploring non-pharmacologic means for managing the disease and in particular through dietary substances or bioactive phytochemicals in fruits, vegetables, and plants or their products. MAST4HEALTH aims at exploring the effect of Mastiha, a natural product of Greece which was recently shown to possess antioxidant/anti-inflammatory and lipid lowering properties. We designed a multicenter randomized double blind placebo controlled (parallel arm) clinical trial to test the effectiveness of Mastiha supplement as new non-pharmacologic strategy for NAFLD/NASH treatment. MAST4HEALTH will explore  gene-diet interactions, more specifically the potential personalized activity of the Mastiha, and correlate genetic and epigenetic markers with metabolomic and intestinal microbiota profiles pre- and post-intervention. The effectiveness of the proposed intervention will be evaluated via clinical and laboratory markers of the disease.

In most research communities, there is a growing awareness that the “rising tide of data” will require new approaches to data management and that data preservation, access and sharing should be supported in a much better way. Data, and a fortiori Big Data, is a cross-cutting issue touching all research infrastructures. 

EUDAT2020’s vision is to enable European researchers and practitioners from any research discipline to preserve, find, access, and process data in a trusted environment, as part of a Collaborative Data Infrastructure (CDI) conceived as a network of collaborating, cooperating centres, combining the richness of numerous community-specific data repositories with the permanence and persistence of some of Europe’s largest scientific data centres. 

EUDAT2020 builds on the foundations laid by the first EUDAT project, strengthening the links between the CDI and expanding its functionalities and remit. Covering both access and deposit, from informal data sharing to long-term archiving, and addressing identification, discoverability and computability of both long-tail and big data, EUDAT2020’s services will address the full lifecycle of research data. 

One of the main ambitions of EUDAT2020 is to bridge the gap between research infrastructures and e-Infrastructures through an active engagement strategy, using the communities that are in the consortium as EUDAT beacons and integrating others through innovative partnerships. 

During its three-year funded life, EUDAT2020 will evolve the CDI into a healthy and vibrant data-infrastructure for Europe, and position EUDAT as a sustainable infrastructure within which the future, changing requirements of a wide range of research communities are addressed.",18899725.69,18865385,H2020-EINFRA-2014-2,RIA,CSC-TIETEEN TIETOTEKNIIKAN KESKUS OY,FI,HELSINGIN YLIOPISTO;LUNDS UNIVERSITET;FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JULICH GMBH;KONINKLIJKE NEDERLANDSE AKADEMIE VAN WETENSCHAPPEN - KNAW;EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY;ETHNIKO DIKTYO EREVNAS TECHNOLOGIAS AE;E-SCIENCE DATA FACTORY;DEUTSCHES KLIMARECHENZENTRUM GMBH;UPPSALA UNIVERSITET;INSTYTUT CHEMII BIOORGANICZNEJ POLSKIEJ AKADEMII NAUK;SURFSARA BV;HELMHOLTZ ZENTRUM POTSDAM DEUTSCHESGEOFORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GFZ;SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FACILITIES COUNCIL;CENTRE EUROPEEN DE RECHERCHE ET DE FORMATION AVANCEE EN CALCUL SCIENTIFIQUE;UNITED KINGDOM RESEARCH AND INNOVATION;KARLSRUHER INSTITUT FUER TECHNOLOGIE;UNITED KINGDOM ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY;KONINKLIJK NEDERLANDS METEOROLOGISCH INSTITUUT-KNMI;EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION FOR NUCLEAR RESEARCH;TRUST-IT SERVICES LIMITED;UNINETT SIGMA2 AS;CLARIN ERIC;BIOSENSE INSTITUTE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN BIOSYSTEMS;JISC LBG;STICHTING LIBER;UNINETT SIGMA AS;UNIVERZITET U NOVOM SADU;EBERHARD KARLS UNIVERSITAET TUEBINGEN;ISTITUTO NAZIONALE DI GEOFISICA E VULCANOLOGIA;MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON;CINECA CONSORZIO INTERUNIVERSITARIO;UMWELTBUNDESAMT GESELLSCHAFT MIT BESCHRANKTER HAFTUNG (UBA GMBH);CINES;THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH;BARCELONA SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER - CENTRO NACIONAL DE SUPERCOMPUTACION,FI;SE;DE;NL;EL;FR;PL;UK;CH;NO;RS;IT;AT;ES,NA

The project will seek to answer the following questions:

i. Why do illiberal political discourses resonate with people in post-communist Europe? 

ii. With which types of people do illiberal discourses particularly resonate? 

iii. Under which social, economic and political circumstances are illiberal discourses most likely to gain traction? 

iv. How do illiberal political actors make their views of the world hegemonic? Which social, political and economic conditions of possibility enable such hegemonic worldviews to dominate political discourse? 

v. Which framing activities are employed by cultural-political entrepreneurs via specific media and educational institutions to make their views of the world hegemonic? 

vi. What are the remedies to the current illiberalism? What role does education play in making society aware of the dangers of playing with right-wing ideas. 

The research programme will be organised in five work packages, each centred on a research theme pertinent to one or more post-communist EU member-states, accession states or states in the EU’s Eastern Partnership.

The DESIR project sets out to strengthen the sustainability of DARIAH and firmly establish it as a long-term leader and partner within arts and humanities communities. By DESIR’s definition, sustainability is an evolving 6-dimensional process, divided into the following challenges:

Dissemination: DESIR will organise a series dissemination events, including workshops in the US and Australia, to promote DARIAH tools and services and initiative collaborations.
Growth: DESIR sets out to prepare the ground for establishing DARIAH membership in six new countries: the UK, Finland, Spain, Switzerland, Czech Republic and Israel.
Technology: DESIR will widen the DARIAH research infrastructure in three areas, vital for DARIAH’s long-term sustainability: entity-based search, scholarly content management, visualization and text analytic services.
Robustness: DESIR will make DARIAH’s organizational structure and governance fit for the future and develop a detailed business plan and marketing strategy.
Trust: DESIR will measure the acceptance of DARIAH, especially in new communities, and define mechanisms to support trust and confidence in DARIAH.
Education: Through training and teaching DESIR will promote the use of DARIAH tools and services.

This platform will be built by leading European developers, resource providers, e-infrastructures and scientific communities in order to ensure its successful exploitation and sustainability.

All members of the consortium share the common interest in developing advanced middleware to sustain the deployment of service models and user tools to tackle the challenges of the Big Data era. INDIGO will exploit the formidable know-how that was built in Europe along the past ten years of collaborations on scientific computing based on different consolidated and emerging paradigms (HPC, Grid and Cloud).

Regarding Cloud computing, both the public and private sectors are already offering IaaS-type Cloud resources. However, numerous areas are of interest to scientific communities where Cloud computing uptake is currently lacking, especially at the PaaS and SaaS levels. The project therefore aims at developing tools and platforms based on open source solutions addressing scientific challenges in the Cloud computing, storage and network areas.

INDIGO will allow application development and execution on Cloud and Grid based infrastructures, as well as on HPC clusters.

In order to deal with such challenges, the operator needs full situational awareness, which can be achieved by sensing relevant visual data about the operating environment, refining it into mission-critical information, and presenting it in an immersive, intuitively comprehensible manner. This can be achieved by Immersive Visual Technologies (IVT) delivering ultra-realistic and interactive visual experience. 

The aim of ImmerSAFE is to train multi-disciplinary experts, who have an understanding of the core imaging technologies, the requirements set to them by the safety-critical applications and who can account for the human user in the design of such systems. We will advance the state of the art by working towards three specific objectives: (1) Develop new robust and reliable IVT; in particular novel approaches to sensing, visualisation and reliable data transmission. (2) Determine optimal implementation of IVT under challenging conditions and integration into existing frameworks in two example use cases: mobile work machines and control centres. (3) Increase knowledge on the human factors affecting the adoption and use of IVT through user experience testing, task performance metrics and organisational level studies.

- to evolve the Performance Scheme towards new methodologies and metrics capable of capturing with proportional detail the performance drivers of ATM to foster a progressive and performance-driven introduction of new operational and technical ATM concepts in line with SESAR; 
- to make an (initial) impact assessment of long-term ATM concepts with the new APACHE Performance Scheme, to measure the impact on ATM KPAs under different assumptions in line with the SESAR ConOps 2020\; and
- to analyse the interdependencies between the different KPAs at the Pareto-frontier of the ATM performance, by finding the theoretical optimal limits for each KPA and assessing how the promotion of one KPA may actually reduce the performance of the other KPAs
An initial performance assessment of new concepts of operations will be required, covering the new concepts t: free-routing in 2D (2DFR) and in 3D (3DFR) for airline operators; dynamic airspace configuration (DAC) for air navigation service providers (ANSPs); and dynamic demand and capacity balance (dDCB) for the Network Manager (NM).

This has been accompanied by a stability of social practices resistant to change. Shaken by radically changing ideological and legal structures, citizens rely on customary and informal social networks of kin, symbolic kin, and friends for meeting economic needs, and on clan- or kin-related structures rather than the rule of law for security and protection. We trace the persistence of informal practices to: 1) the external origin of major transformations, including the “transitions” to and from socialism; 2) the incomplete character of change, which has tended to be replaced by equally radical but diametrically opposed projects; 3) the development of a buffer culture based on informal practices, directed to enabling people to survive under unstable conditions; and 4) the widening gap between formal institutions and informal social practices.
The distance between proclaimed goals and existing practices represents the key challenge to the European integration of Balkan societies. The integration process could end with superficial change, behind which the 'real' social life of corruption, clientelism, tension, inequality, and exclusion will continue to unfold. We propose to explicate the key formal and informal “rules of the game”, and to identify and decipher the 'unwritten rules' which underpin tactical maneuvering between formal and informal institutions, in various spheres and at various levels of social life. These would then be compared to the demands and recommendations laid out in the key EU documents outlining expectations from Southeast European states. The goal is to contribute to the formulation of policy recommendations which would aim not to eradicate informal practices, but to close the gap between formal and informal institutions in Balkan societies.'",2486331.5,2486331.5,H2020-INT-SOCIETY-2015,RIA,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,UK,INSTITUT ZA DEMOKRATIJA SOCIETAS CIVILIS SKOPJE;INSTITUT ZA ETNOLOGIJU I FOLKLORISTIKU;CENTER FOR EMPIRICAL CULTURAL STUDIES OF SOUTH EAST EUROPE;RIGAS STRADINA UNIVERSITATE;UNIVERZA V MARIBORU;CENTAR ZA INTRADISCIPLINARNA PRIMIJENJENA DRUSTVENA ISTRAZIVANJA;QENDRA E KERKIMEVE HISTORIKE DHE ANTROPOLOGJIKE;SOCIAL RESEARCH KOSOVA LLC,MK;HR;RS;LV;SI;BA;AL;XK,NA

The classical Theory (Kahneman, 1973) considers the level of arousal reliant only on psychological factors (stress, fatigue and emotions). Automation would only affect the task complexity by allocating part of the cognitive processing to the system. Alternative theories such as Malleable Attentional Resources Theory (MART) (Young and Stanton, 2002) assumes that automation would also affect the level of arousal and be dependent on controller´s expectations: when the ATCo expects that the task is easy in the near future, she/he will reduce the arousal levels and get bored or sleepy (overconfidence on automation). On the contrary, fears of automation failing would increase stress and also the level of arousal causing disorientation, overacting or erratic behaviour.
Based on these theories, AUTOPACE proposes basic research on a Psychological Model to quantitatively predict how automation would impact on human performance based on cognitive resources modeling (demanded and available), tasks characteristics (automation), psychological factors modeling (fatigue, stress and emotions) and ATCo expectations (overconfidence vs fears of automation).
A catalogue of training strategies to support the controller being “in-the-loop” will be explored. For the classical Theory, the strategies only for keeping attention on the main task avoiding out-of-the-loop effect. For the MART the coach will be also for coping with stress. A reviewed Curricula and ATCo Selection will be initiated.
Expert Judgment from Psychologists, ATM Experts and Controllers Trainers supported by Literature Research will look at future competences and training strategies. The research on Psychological Modeling will be also sustained with Analytical Studies by using an existing prototype for demanded resources.

There are many research and policy projects and incubation and acceleration programmes with valuable outcomes but these are still largely disconnected. Thus, the overarching aim of this project is to create a ‘network of networks’ of social innovation actors.

Through our cross-cutting Work Packages, we will deliver engagement, research, experimentation, learning and policy activities that engage with and support each of the networks. We will ensure that our cross-cutting activities are complementary and build on each other’s work, rather than operating in silos. As such, this SIC aims to deepen and strengthen existing networks, forge new connections between networks, and create new links to actors and networks which hitherto have not been included in the field of social innovation. The aims of such a community are to generate new social innovations, develop and scale up successful ideas to share and spread knowledge more effectively in order to improve research, practice and policy-making.

As a result, there is currently a lot of uncertainty among policymakers and investors in the heating and cooling sector, primarily due to a lack of knowledge about the long-term changes that will occur in the coming decades. This HRE proposal will enable new policies as well as prepare the ground for new investments by creating more certainty in relation to the changes that are required. The work in this proposal will build on three previous HRE studies, all of which have been successfully completed on time and all of which have already influenced high-level policymakers at EU and national level in Europe. The work from these previous studies will be significantly improved in this project. The new knowledge in this project will:
-          Improve at least 15 new policies at local, national, or EU level, 
-          Specify how up to 3,000,000 GWh/year of fossil fuels can be saved in Europe, and
-          Quantify how the €3 trillion of investment required to implement these savings will reduce the net cost of heating and cooling in Europe.

Furthermore, one of the most significant improvements compared to previous studies is the dissemination and communication strategy that has been developed as part of this proposal. These activities represent the largest work package in this proposal, which is necessary to ensure that policymakers, investors, and researchers at local, national, and EU level are all aware of the new data, tools, methodologies, and results from this project.

By mimicking the characteristics of the natural tactile feedback, it will substantially increase the quality of immersive VR experience used locally or remotely (tele-manipulation). 
The approach is based on transcutaneous electro-tactile stimulation delivered through electrical pulses with high resolution spatio-temporal distribution. To achieve it, significant development of technologies for transcutaneous stimulation, textile-based multi-pad electrodes and tactile sensation electronic skin, coupled with ground-breaking research of perception of elicited tactile sensations in VR, is needed. 
The key novelty is in the combination of:
1)	the ground-breaking research of perception of electrotactile stimuli for the identification of the stimulation parameters and methods that evoke natural like tactile sensations, 
2)	the advanced hardware, that will integrate the novel high-resolution electrotactile stimulation system and state of the art artificial electronic skin patches with smart textile technologies and VR control devices in a wearable mobile system, and 
3)	the novel firmware, that handles real-time encoding and transmission of tactile information from virtual objects in VR, as well as from the distant tactile sensors (artificial skins) placed on robotic or human hands.

This goal requires a major effort to increase the number of qualified construction specialists at all levels, which is directly related to the accessibility and quality of the training and educational programmes and the inclusion of training on intelligent energy efficiency and RES solutions in building renovation. Responding to these needs, the project is designed to:
(i)	Elaborate a set of technological competences and learning outcomes on deep energy renovation;
(ii)	Develop new large scale training schemes and programmes on deep energy renovation at all levels of the vocational education and training (VET) system;
(iii)	Review the national educational plans and initiate the necessary changes;
(iv)	Establish capacity for professional training of trainers and train a sufficient number of trainers;
(v)	Support and monitor pilot courses on the new programmes on deep energy renovation at all levels.
The leading objective of the Fit-to-nZEB project proposal is to deliver all necessary requisites for the introduction of educational content on deep energy renovation of buildings in the curricula at all levels of the educational and training system in Southeastern Europe. This will be done both through incorporation of new educational content in existing curricula and through the development of new specialized programs. This process will be guided by the understanding of the complex nature of building retrofit, combining various building disciplines and allowing integrated design and cross-craft understanding with special focus on practical exercises and demonstrations.

We will focus on three major CID indications with distinct characteristics, yet a large overlap of their molecular risk map: inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematodes and rheumatoid arthritis. We have joined 15 partners from major cohorts and initiatives in Europe (e.g.IHEC, ICGC, TwinsUK and Meta-HIT) to investigate human data sets on three major levels of resolution: whole blood signatures, signatures from purified immune cell types (with a focus on CD14 and CD4/CD8) and selected single cell level analyses.  Principle data layers will comprise SNP variome, methylome, transcriptome and gut microbiome. SYSCID employs a dedicated data management infrastructure, strong algorithmic development groups (including an SME for exploitation of innovative software tools for data deconvolution) and will validate results in independent retrospective and prospective clinical cohorts. 
Using this setup we will focus on three fundamental aims : (i) the identification of shared and unique 'core disease signatures” which are associated with the disease state and independent of temporal variation, (ii) the generation of 'predictive models of disease outcome'- builds on previous work that pathways/biomarkers for disease outcome are distinct from initial disease risk and may be shared across diseases to guide therapy decisions on an individual patient basis, (iii) 'reprogramming disease'- will identify and target temporally stable epigenetic alterations in macrophages and lymphocytes in epigenome editing approaches as biological validation and potential novel therapeutic tool  .
Thus, SYSCID will foster the development of solid biomarkers and models as stratification in future long-term systems medicine clinical trials but also investigate new causative therapies by editing the epigenome code in specific immune cells, e.g.  to alleviate macrophage polarization defects.'",16018111.25,14456236.25,H2020-SC1-2016-RTD,RIA,CHRISTIAN-ALBRECHTS-UNIVERSITAET  ZU KIEL,DE,UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE;HUMANITAS UNIVERSITY;THE CHANCELLOR MASTERS AND SCHOLARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE;UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE;COMMA SOFT AG;GENOS DOO ZA VJESTACENJE I ANALIZU;EURICE EUROPEAN RESEARCH AND PROJECT OFFICE GMBH;IDRYMA IATROVIOLOGIKON EREUNON AKADEMIAS ATHINON;RHEINISCHE FRIEDRICH-WILHELMS-UNIVERSITAT BONN;UNIVERSITE DU LUXEMBOURG;SYDDANSK UNIVERSITET;VIB;KING'S COLLEGE LONDON;UNIVERSITAT DES SAARLANDES,BE;IT;UK;CH;DE;HR;EL;LU;DK,NA

- well-targeted experimental activity to solve a number of open technical issues (both process- and product-related), by using the appropriate combination of innovative and catalogue-proven technologies.
- market analysis whitin several economic scenarios and business models for full exploitation of bio-based products (including a path forward to fill regulatory gaps).
Urban bio-waste include the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (from households, restaurants, caterers and retail premises), excess sludge from urban wastewater treatment, garden and parks waste, selected waste from food-processing (if better recycling options in the food chain are not available), other selected waste streams, i.e. baby nappies.

A consequence of this fragmentation, there is a negative impact on the cost in the provision of ATM service in Europe.  
A fundamental goal of the Single European Sky initiative is to “provide ATM services to airspace users at a cost of at least 50 % less”. 
The notion of Common Service aims to contribute to this goal. Common Services, defined as “a service that provides capability to consumers in the same way that they would otherwise need to provide themselves”, aims to mitigate this issue. Common Service approach follows a general principle within the Single European Sky initiative that encourages the harmonisation on the provision of common air navigation services wherever it is possible.
The main benefit of this approach is to deliver enhanced cost effectiveness to both the providing and consuming organisations and this could in turn potentially benefit the whole chain in the European air transportation business, making it more attractive as means of transport. Additionally, there could be a positive impact on other ATM performance areas as well, such as capacity, safety, flight efficiency, etc.
The providing organisations would benefit from economy of scale, while the consumers would not need to maintain and update proprietary solutions anymore. Overall, a better rationalisation of deployment should be expected.
Therefore this Common Service approach, if it is proved to be successful, could be viewed as an essential means to improve the overall cost effectiveness of the ATM business in Europe.

Commercial ship routes joining Europe with other cultures are vivid examples of cultural interaction, while shipwrecks and submerged sites, unreachable to wide public are excellent samples that can benefit from immersive technologies, augmented and virtual reality. 
iMARECULTURE will bring inherently unreachable underwater cultural heritage within digital reach of the wide public using virtual visits and immersive technologies. Apart from reusing existing 3D data of underwater shipwrecks and sites, with respect to ethics, rights and licensing, to provide a personalized dry visit to a museum visitor or augmented reality to the diver, it also emphasizes on developing pre- and after- encounter of the digital visitor. The former one is implemented exploiting geospatial enabled technologies for developing a serious game of sailing over ancient Mediterranean and the latter for an underwater shipwreck excavation game.

Reaching the goals for the European Airspace is only possible with focused technical developments on European level.
The air traffic controller is the main player in the traffic management at tactical level. This project aims at providing the air traffic controller with more automated tools, thus freeing capacity for situations where human intervention is crucial. This provides even safer service for an increasing amount of traffic and with lower costs, as required by airspace users.
This project is a part of the SESAR programme and addresses separation management. It will not only improve current conflict detection tools, but also develop new tools aiding the air traffic controller with resolution advisory and monitoring of flight trajectory. 
The project also addresses new ways of working together.  Air traffic controllers traditionally work in pairs and in specific airspace. Could we change this to multi-planner setup, sector less airspace and seamless cross-border operations? Our project will ensure the research is developed to a stage where it can be used in operational air traffic management systems in Europe. This ensures that anyone can fly safer, cheaper and quicker in Europe in 10 years. 
Another really important issue is the integration of “Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems” – drones.  Drones are new to European Air Traffic Management, and it is urgent to address concepts and technological developments needed to handle this kind of traffic safely.
The companies involved in this project are the only ones that can deliver this kind of result. Not on their own – but as the unique cooperation between air navigation service providers and air and ground industry. The capabilities to provide sustainable results usable throughout Europe by fast-time, real-time simulations and live trials ensures that developed prototypes are working in the context of future traffic and ATM systems.",43248874.13,26388518.93,H2020-SESAR-2015-2,SESAR-RIA,DFS DEUTSCHE FLUGSICHERUNG GMBH,DE,"AIRBUS;AUSTRO CONTROL OSTERREICHISCHE GESELLSCHAFT FUR ZIVILLUFTFAHRT MBH;POLSKA AGENCJA ZEGLUGI POWIETRZNEJ;SAAB AKTIEBOLAG;HUNGAROCONTROL MAGYAR LEGIFORGALMISZOLGALAT ZARTKORUEN MUKODO RESZVENYTARSASAG;RIZENI LETOVEHO PROVOZU CESKE REPUBLIKY STATNI PODNIK;STICHTING NATIONAAL LUCHT- EN RUIMTEVAARTLABORATORIUM;STIFTELSEN SINTEF;SKYGUIDE, SA SUISSE POUR LES SERVICES DE LA NAVIGATION AERIENNE CIVILS ET MILITAIRES;DIRECTION DES SERVICES DE LA NAVIGATION AERIENNE;ENAV SPA;ENAIRE;VALSTYBES IMONE ORO NAVIGACIJA;EUROCONTROL - EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR THE SAFETY OF AIR NAVIGATION;ATOS BELGIUM;CROATIA CONTROL, CROATIAN AIR NAVIGATION SERVICES LTD;DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUER LUFT - UND RAUMFAHRT EV;FREQUENTIS AG;INDRA SISTEMAS SA;THALES LAS FRANCE SAS;NATS (EN ROUTE) PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY;DASSAULT AVIATION;LETOVE PREVADZKOVE SLUZBY SLOVENSKEJ REPUBLIKY, STATNY PODNIK;UDARAS EITLIOCHTA NA HEIREANN THE IRISH AVIATION AUTHORITY;LEONARDO - SOCIETA PER  AZIONI;NAVIAIR;LUFTFARTSVERKET;AIRTEL ATN LIMITED",FR;AT;PL;SE;HU;CZ;NL;NO;CH;IT;ES;LT;BE;HR;DE;UK;SK;IE;DK,NA

The key objectives of the project are (1) providing guidance for EU and MS minerals policy, (2) facilitating minerals policy decision making through knowledge co-production for transferability of best practice minerals policy, and (3) fostering community and network building for the co-management of an innovation catalysing minerals policy framework.
This will be achieved through a systematic profiling and policy benchmarking of relevant policy and legislation in Europe, which includes the identification of innovation friendly best practices through quantitative indicators and a qualitative analysis country-specific framework conditions, as well as through the compilation of minerals statistics and reporting systems. These insights will form the basis for developing an interactive, tailor-made online ‘Minerals Policy Guide’. Another key feature of the MIN-GUIDE project will be knowledge co-production for minerals policy decision makers through Policy Laboratories exploring these best practice examples along the whole mineral production value chain (exploration and extraction, processing, recycling and mine closure). Furthermore, MIN-GUIDE will facilitate the building of a sustainable minerals policy stakeholder network through this knowledge co-production and utilization in Policy Laboratories as well as through three major Conferences. These Conferences will explore the minerals governance framework, work on recommendations for promoting innovation along the whole minerals production value chain, and put it into the wider context of the circular economy.

Against this background, innovative mechanisms (IM), including novel policies and business models, have the potential to align ecosystem services supply and demand. SINCERE will, first, systematically map the existing knowledge and practical experiences with IM at the European scale. Second, it will, in a joint effort of practice partners and researchers, design, implement and subsequently evaluate a complementary set of innovation actions that explore novel IM in different regional contexts. These actions encompass a broad spectrum of forest ecosystem services (e.g. biodiversity, climate change mitigation, water supply, recreation), governance mechanisms (e.g. new business models, ‘reverse auctions’ with forest owners, participatory governance) and regional settings (e.g. intensively managed commercial forests in Finland versus little-managed forest land in Spain). Third, a Learning Architecture will connect these innovation actions across countries to incentivize cross-case fertilization and learning between research and practice. Finally, practice partners, policy makers and researchers will jointly draw lessons learnt from the innovation actions, including the upscaling of successful IM to be replicated elsewhere.

In addition, the corresponding actuating technologies responsible for applying various measures (e.g. irrigation, fertilization) need to become more precise and allow variable rate inputs with a resolution down to an individual plant.
To provide novel sensing and actuating solutions able to address the burning issues in agriculture today, NOCTURNO will bring together and synergistically advance several highly promising research directions which have been investigated separately in the last decade: wave-matter interactions, plasmonics, complex media and artificial materials, acoustic, electromagnetics, optics, bionanosensing.
The Project will focus on development of sensors and actuators based on non-conventional propagation of acoustic waves in artificial media, electromagnetic/optical sensors based on metasurfaces, and advanced manufacturing technologies including 3D printing, laser-micromachining technology, and e-beam lithography with the aim to provide practical solutions for the fabrication of novel acoustic and metasurface-based sensors and actuators.
NOCTURNO proposes an exchange programme which brings together three European academic institutions, two European SME companies, and two third-country universities.

Nowadays, medical imaging technologies play a key role to face the ever-growing number of challenges due to aging populations, as they are the essential clinical tool to deliver accurate initial diagnosis and monitor the evolution of disease over time. For this reason, a whole range of new imaging modalities is currently being developed to supplement and support current modalities. Among these technologies, there is EM imaging, which involves the illumination of the portion of the body under investigation with low-power non-ionizing EM waves (in the microwave spectrum) and the use of the resultant backscattered signals to generate images of the internal structures of the body. 
The scientific objective pursued by the EMERALD action is to accelerate translation of research in EM medical imaging into clinical prototypes. To this end, EMERALD will establish a group of 13 outstanding early stage researchers who will be the European leaders in this field, through a unique scientific and training programme.

This is achieved by exploiting the synergies of a technology portfolio in the areas of: user-centric design with enhanced passenger comfort and safety, lightweight materials with enhanced thermal insulation properties, and optimised vehicle energy management.
The developed technologies will be integrated and qualified in a Honda B-segment electric vehicle validator. Among these, a novel refrigerant for cooling, combined with an energy-saving heat pump operation for heating, advanced thermal storages based on phase change materials, powerfilms for infrared radiative heating, and materials for enhanced thermal insulation of the cabin will be investigated. Further focus is put on lightweight glasses and composites for windows and chassis, as well as light metal aluminium or magnesium seat components. Optimized energy management strategies, such as pre-conditioning and zonal cooling/heating the passenger cabin as well as user-centric designed cooling/heating modules will further enhance the thermal performance of the vehicle. These strategies will be seamlessly implemented in an intelligent vehicle control unit enhanced by a novel Human Machine Interface, which, beyond being intuitive and user friendly, will also consider diverse users’ needs, accounting for gender and ageing society aspects.
The objective of QUIET is to reduce the energy needed for cooling and heating the cabin of an electric vehicle under different driving conditions, by at least 30 % compared to the Honda baseline 2017. Additionally, a weight reduction of about 20 % of vehicle components (e.g. doors, windshields, seats, heating and air conditioning) is also addressed.

These CAs, which are often rare diseases, are a major cause of infant mortality, childhood morbidity and long-term disability. 
EUROCAT is an established European network of population-based registries for the epidemiologic surveillance of CAs. EUROlinkCAT will use the EUROCAT infrastructure to support 21 EUROCAT registries in 13 European countries to link their CA data to mortality, hospital discharge, prescription and educational databases. Each registry will send standard aggregate tables and analysis results to a Central Results Repository (CRR) thus respecting data security issues surrounding sensitive data. The CRR will contain standardised summary data and analyses on an estimated 200,000 children with a CA born from 1995 to 2014 up to age 10, enabling hypotheses on their health and education to be investigated at an EU level. This enhanced information will allow optimisation of personalised care and treatment decisions for children with rare CAs. 
Registries will be supported in using social media platforms to connect with families who live with CAs in their regions. A novel sustainable e-forum, “ConnectEpeople”, will link these families with local, national and international registries and information resources. ConnectEpeople will involve these families in setting research priorities and ensuring a meaningful dissemination of results.
Findings will provide evidence to inform national treatment guidelines, such as concerning screening programs, to optimise diagnosis, prevention and treatment for these children and reduce health inequalities in Europe.  An economic evaluation of the hospitalisation costs associated with CA will be provided

EU-directive 16620/11 invites EU-member states to give priority to such screening programmes. Early detection and treatment of a lazy eye (prevalence 3%) prevents lifelong visual impairment. Early detection and treatment of hearing impairment (prevalence 0.15%) prevents delayed speech and language development.
Across Europe inequity exists in the provision of childhood vision and hearing screening programmes (VAHSPs). High-Income Countries (HICs) have VAHSPs, but they vary with regard to age and frequency of testing, tests used, uptake, screening professionals, referral pathway and funding. This makes it difficult for healthcare providers and policy makers to decide what VAHSP to implement in Low- to Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) and how.
In this study, cost-optimised, evidence-based VAHSPs will be implemented in two LMICs, based on collated evidence from existing VAHSPs in Europe. Data on VAHSPs, demography, administration, general screening, screening professions, uptake and treatment availability will be gathered in an established network of professionals in 41 European countries and used in a disease/health system modelling framework to predict benefits and cost in the most optimal health system, taking regional diversity and organisational and resource requirements into account.
Model-developed VAHSPs will be tested in the county of Cluj in Romania for vision, and in three counties in Albania for hearing screening. A generic strategy for implementation will be developed by detailed tracking, and from identified requirements, facilitators and barriers.

The AM technologies put considerably fewer limits on shape of the manufactured objects than conventional technologies, and offer unparalleled freedom to industrial and mechanical designers. Since the AM technologies are insensitive to production scale, they put in focus knowledge and creativity of designers instead of low prices of mass production, paving the way to development of new business models. The AM technologies, therefore, represent a technology platform that may best serve Europe in its intent to develop knowledge-based economy, driven by innovation.
However, the industrial deployment of AM technologies is hindered by a gap that exists between the excellent research and its exploitation in industry. The research knowledge about the AM technologies is published in scientific journals and in conference proceedings, in form suitable for researchers. On the other hand, industrial and mechanical designers use sets of design rules, which represent condensed and comprehensive form of the research findings that are easy to follow. The lack of sets of design rules for AM technologies is one of important reasons why engineers often prefer conventional technologies to AM.
The proposed project intends to use the research capacities and partnerships developed in previous EU funded projects to carry out systematic studies of dynamic mechanical properties (fatigue, fracture mechanics and impact resistance) of products manufactured by AM with the goal to establish the proper rule sets for design of products. Since the aim of the project is to “translate” the research findings into engineering rules, the consortium consists of two universities and three SMEs that use AM technologies for rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing and rapid tooling.

Making the infrastructures “smarter” usually means making them smarter in normal operation and use: more adaptive, more intelligent… But will these smart critical infrastructures (SCIs) behave equally “smartly” and be “smartly resilient” also when exposed to extreme threats, such as extreme weather disasters or terrorist attacks? If making existing infrastructure “smarter” is achieved by making it more complex, would it also make it more vulnerable? Would this affect resilience of an SCI as its ability to anticipate, prepare for, adapt and withstand, respond to, and recover?
These are the main questions tackled by this proposal.
The proposal envisages answering the above questions in several steps. (#1) By identifying existing indicators suitable for assessing resilience of SCIs. (#2) By identifying new “smart” resilience indicators (RIs) – including those from Big Data. (#3) By developing a new advanced resilience assessment methodology (TRL4) based on smart RIs (“resilience indicators cube”, including the resilience matrix). (#4) By developing the interactive “SCI Dashboard” tool. (#5) By applying the methodology/tools in 8 case studies, integrated under one virtual, smart-city-like, European case study. The SCIs considered (in 8 European countries!) deal with energy, transportation, health, water…
Results #2, #3, #4 and #5 are a breakthrough innovation.
This approach will allow benchmarking the best-practice solutions and identifying the early warnings, improving resilience of SCIs against new threats and cascading and ripple effects. The benefits/savings to be achieved by the project will be assessed by the reinsurance company participant.

They are an important component of European agriculture, notably in terms of biodiversity, cultural landscape, territorial cohesion, quality products and employment. However, abandonment, degradation, economic and social marginalisation are long-standing challenges for the associated farming systems which are still under considerable pressure. For national and local authorities, the European Union and the Common Agricultural Policy, and for stakeholders, the challenge is twofold: 
•  to avoid further degradation and disappearance of HNV farming and increase their socio-economic viability: this could be done by collating, evaluating and disseminating innovations as tools for their development; 
• to maintain their “natural value”, i.e the environmental services they provide to the society. 
For these reasons, our consortium, an EIP Agri Focus Group and new partners, propose a network dedicated to supporting HNV farming, networking HNV areas covering a range of different farming systems across the EU, and to focussing on innovations improving simultaneously “socio-economic viability” and “environmental efficiency”. 
Conceived as a “support service” for knowledge and innovation exchanges, the HNV-Link network will give a decisive new impetus to this sector, and will provide tools to organisations, actors and networks supporting HNV farmlands. The marginality of HNV areas in conventional research and development means that HNV farming-related innovation is rarely discussed in academic exchanges. Our thematic network, both grassroots-based and transnational, can really make a difference, by connecting farmers and innovation actors in line with the vision of the EIP-Agri “operational groups'.

The amount of electric power which can be supplied to the grid depends on the time of the day and weather conditions. A conventional fleet of thermal power plants is required to compensate for these fluctuations before large scale energy storage technologies will be mature and economically viable. All power market projections expect this to be the case for the next 50 years at least. For a strong expansion of renewables, this fleet has to operate flexibly at competitive cost.
Current power plants cannot fill this role immediately without impeding their efficiency and engine lifetime through increased wear and damage induced by the higher number of (shorter) operating/loading cycles. New technologies need to be introduced to  balance demand peaks with renewable output fluctuations at minimal fuel consumption and emissions without negative effects on cycling operation. The FLEXTURBINE partners have developed a medium to long term technology roadmap addressing future and existing power plants. The FLEXTURBINE project presented hereafter is the first step in such technology roadmap and consists of: (1) new solutions for extended operating ranges to predict and control flutter, (2) improved sealing and bearing designs to increase turbine lifetime and efficiency by reducing degradation/damages, and (3) an improved lifecycle management through better control and prediction of critical parts to improve competitive costs by more flexible service intervals and planned downtime, and by reducing unplanned outages. In all areas, individual technologies will be developed from TRL 3 to TRL 4-6.

The challenges of modernising the electricity grids in Europe lies in enabling an increased flexibility of the European power system, efficiently providing increased transfer capacity and enabling an active participation of users and new market actors (by providing the information, services, market architectures and privacy guarantees).
To address these challenges, innovation is needed in system integration, interoperable technologies, services, tools, co-ordination schemes, business processes, market architectures and regulatory regimes to plan, build, monitor, control and safely operate end-to-end networks in an open, competitive, decarbonised, sustainable and climate-change resilient market, under normal and emergency conditions.

The major challenge is now to overcome the fragmentation of knowledge and accelerate knowledge exchange between the already existing demonstration projects and R&D initiatives with the goal to enable them to develop European wide interoperable solutions, according to a common reference architecture. With this, critical masses shall be reached in the development of a European market for smart grids technology providers and smart grids service providers.

This initiative does not intend to find the final specifications for smart grids, but to organise the learning down to regional Smart Grids stakeholders, beyond the demonstration phase towards implementation.

We expect that through an enhanced cooperation and networking between these national entities, a higher quality of their consulting services and thus of proposals and projects can be achieved. Therefore, the overall objective of NCPs CaRE is to form a joint cooperation network of experienced and less experienced NCPs on SC5 “Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials” which aims at pooling their resources and know-how to raise the overall quality of services provided to their clients.

By involving 24 formally nominated National Contact Points across Europe, the NCPs CaRE project will significantly strengthen trans-national cooperation. In addition, NCPs CaRE will extensively involve the 26 NCPs that have decided to become “associated partner”. To harness synergies is especially relevant to SC5 NCPs, since potential applicants within this Challenge are very diverse with respect to their scientific or organisational background, level of experience, involvement in transnational networks.

Concretely, activities of NCPs CaRE towards this goal include, amongst others, teaming and twinning schemes, the compilation of best practices handbooks and manuals, events, meetings and trainings both on-line and on a face-to-face basis, as well as a wide range of other communication and dissemination tools and platforms.

These activities foreseen by NCPs CaRE will contribute to enhancing the impact of R&I in SC5 and ensure a more efficient use of resources and R&I developments by improving the work flow between NCPs, applicants, the Commission, and other parties with a stake in SC5. Tailor-made like they are for the SC5 constituency, these activities will make it easier for all participating and benefitting NCPs to enhance the number of proposals with regards to both quantity and quality.",1999933.75,1999932,H2020-SC5-2014-one-stage,CSA,FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JULICH GMBH,DE,"CENTRO PARA EL DESARROLLO TECNOLOGICO INDUSTRIAL.;SIHTASUTUS EESTI TEADUSAGENTUUR;RANNSOKNAMIDSTOD ISLANDS;MINISTARSTVO PROSVETE, NAUKE I TEHNOLOSKOG RAZVOJA;DIENST VOOR WETENSCHAPPELIJKE EN TECHNISCHE INFORMATIE- SERVICE D'INFORMATION SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE;IDRYMA PROOTHISIS EREVNAS;CENTRUL PROIECTE INTERNATIONALE;AGENZIA PER LA PROMOZIONE DELLA RICERCA EUROPEA;NATIONAL TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AUTHORITY;AGENCE BRUXELLOISE POUR L'ACCOMPAGNEMENT DE L'ENTREPRISE;CENTRUM VEDECKO TECHNICKYCH INFORMACII SLOVENSKEJ REPUBLIKY;LUXINNOVATION GIE;AGENCE BRUXELLOISE POUR L'ENTREPRISE;FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY HELLAS;MINISTERIE VAN ECONOMISCHE ZAKEN EN KLIMAAT;SUOMEN AKATEMIA;INSTITUT ZA NUKLEARNE NAUKE VINCA;INSTITUTIA DE CERCETARE SI DEZVOLTARE DIN REPUBLICA MOLDOVA;INSTYTUT PODSTAWOWYCH PROBLEMOW TECHNIKI POLSKIEJ AKADEMII NAUK;MATIMOP, ISRAELI INDUSTRY CENTER FOR RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT;AGENCE DE L'ENVIRONNEMENT ET DE LAMAITRISE DE L'ENERGIE;AGENCIJA ZA MOBILNOST I PROGRAME EUROPSKE UNIJE;VEREIN EURESEARCH;TECHNOLOGICKE CENTRUM AKADEMIE VED CESKE REPUBLIKY;Ministrstvo za izobrazevanje, znanost in sport;FUNDACAO PARA A CIENCIA E A TECNOLOGIA",ES;EE;IS;RS;BE;CY;MD;IT;IL;SK;LU;EL;NL;FI;PL;FR;HR;CH;CZ;SI;PT,NA

By combining bottom–up perspectives with an institutional approach, EUNPACK will increase our understanding of how EU crisis responses function and are received on the ground in crisis areas. This entails exploring local agencies and perceptions in target countries without losing sight of the EU’s institutions and their expectations and ambitions. It also entails examining the whole cycle of crisis, from pre-crisis, through crisis, and into post-crisis phase. EUNPACK analyses two gaps in EU crisis response. First, the intentions–implementation gap, which relates to 1) the capacity to make decisions and respond with one voice and to deploy the necessary resources, 2) how these responses are implemented on the ground by various EU institutions and member states, and 3) how other actors – local and international – enhance or undermine the EU’s activities. Second, the project addresses the gap between the implementation of EU policies and approaches, and how these policies and approaches are received and perceived in target countries, what we refer to as the implementation¬–local reception/perceptions gap. Our main hypothesis is that the severity of the two gaps is a decisive factor for the EU’s impacts on crisis management and thereby its ability to contribute more effectively to problem-solving on the ground. We analyse these gaps through cases that reflect the variation of EU crisis responses in three concentric areas surrounding the EU: the enlargement area (Kosovo, Serbia), the neighbourhood area (Ukraine, Libya), and the extended neighbourhood (Mali, Iraq, Afghanistan).

The main problem is that, while from the user’s (drivers) point of view a road is a unique linear infrastructure generally in open terrain and sometimes in closed environment (tunnels), a strict application of the two Directives leads to a non-uniform approach to the infrastructure safety management outside and inside tunnels.
To overcome this barrier, Ecoroad aims at the establishment of a common enhanced approach to road infrastructure and tunnel safety management by using concepts and criteria of  the Directive 2008/96/CE on road infrastructure safety management and the results of related EC funded projects. 
Such objective will be achieved through the following specific objectives:
-	Workshops with the stakeholders (European tunnel and road managers); Analysis/review of national practices regarding Road Safety Inspections (RSI) and Road Safety Audit (RSA), starting from the results of the 2 studies recently launched by DG Move to assess the impact of the two Directives 2008/96/EC (on road infrastructure safety management)  and 2004/54/EC (on tunnels)
-	Exchange of best practices and experiences between European tunnel experts and road safety professionals
-	Pilot joint safety operations in some European road sections having both open roads and tunnels
-	Recommendations and guidelines for the application of the RSA and RSI concepts within the tunnel safety operations
Thanks to the high transferability of the ECOROADS results, the present formal gap (explained in details in the following paragraph) between the Directive 2008/96/EC and the Directive 2004/54/EC will be completely filled and will lead to “ faster, more sustainable and better planned interventions.'",999500,999500,H2020-MG-2014_SingleStage_B,CSA,FORUM DES LABORATOIRES NATIONAUX EUROPEENS DE RECHERCHE ROUTIERE,BE,ASSOCIATION EUROPEENNE DES CONCESSIONNAIRES D'AUTOROUTES ET D'OUVRAGESA PEAGE;EUROPEAN TRANSPORT SAFETY COUNCIL;ASSOCIAZIONE ITALIANA DEI PROFESSIONISTI PER LA SICUREZZA STRADALE;EUROPEAN UNION ROAD FEDERATION;SOUTH-EAST EUROPE TRANSPORT OBSERVATORY,FR;BE;IT;RS,NA

The project will implement a methodology that has been successful in promoting demand-driven innovations in previous regional and European projects. This approach is mainly based on the interactions between a network of facilitator agents, several regional technical working groups and one European scientific working group. A participatory approach is used to translate results from science and practical knowledge into technical datasheets that are used to prepare materials adapted to end-users. A bottom-up approach is also used to identify a demand-driven innovation agenda. In the WINETWORK project, the approach will be implemented in ten regions from seven countries representing more than 90% of the EU wine production. The main topic addressed in the network concern the control and the fight against diseases that jeopardise the future production potential of the EU (Grapevine Trunk Diseases and Flavescence Dorée). As they represent a threat for the economic viability of the entire sector, these topics have been previously identified as a priority by winegrowers, scientists and decision-makers. As many winegrowers are testing innovative and sustainable approaches to fight these diseases, it is very beneficial to capture these ideas and to share them between EU countries. Innovative practices will be synthesized, tailored and translated to become fully accessible to innovation support services and to winegrowers.

Modern transportation systems and services have to mitigate problems emerging from complex mobility environments and intensive use of transport networks including excessive CO2 emissions, high congestion levels and reduced quality of life. Due to the saturation of most urban networks, innovative solutions to the above problems need to be underpinned by collecting, processing and broadcasting an abundance of data from various sensors, systems and service providers. Furthermore, such novel transport systems have to foresee situations in near real time and provide the means for proactive decisions, which in turn will deter problems before they even emerge. Our vision is to provide the required interoperability, adaptability and dynamicity in modern transport systems for a proactive and problem-free transportation system. OPTIMUM will establish a largely scalable, distributed architecture for the management and processing of multisource big-data, enabling continuous monitoring of transportation systems needs and proposing proactive decisions and actions in an (semi-) automatic way. OPTIMUM follows a cognitive approach based on the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act loop of the big data supply chain for continuous situational awareness. OPTIMUM's goals will be achieved by incorporating and advancing state of the art in transport and traffic modeling, travel behavior analysis, sentiment analysis, big data processing, predictive analysis and real-time event-based processing, persuasive technologies and proactive recommenders.

CARBAZYMES addresses these challenges by assembling an interdisciplinary and intersectoral consortium as a powerful synergistic tool to promote innovation in the field of biocatalytic C-C bond formation at large scale, and thus the global competitiveness of the European chemical and pharmaceutical industry. The proposed consortium, with 50% industrial participation, represents academia but also commercial interests in different stages of the research-to-market process. This top-down approach, together with a life-cycle innovation approach ensures an industrial drive to the project.
Clearly aligned with the scope of topic BIOTEC3-2014, CARBAZYMES will pursue the biocatalytic synthesis (spanning TRLs 5-7) of 4 APIs and 3 bulk chemicals –corresponding to market needs detected by the industrial partners in the Consortium. This will be accomplished through an inter-disciplinary approach which includes: i) a broad platform of 4 types of unique C-C bond-forming enzymes, mostly lyases; ii) the capacity to rapidly evolve enzymes to operate under industrial conditions by means of novel enzyme panels and massive screening methods; iii) application of microreactor technology for bioprocess characterization; iv) demonstration actions comprising technical (up to 100L) and economic viability studies carried out by industrial partners.
CARBAZYMES unmistakably aims to have social and economic impact by addressing markets worth bn €, developing enzyme evolution technologies beyond the state of the art and creating qualified jobs and technical-scale facilities at the industrial partners’ sites.

The InSilc platform is based on the extension of existing multidisciplinary and multiscale models for simulating the drug-eluting BVS mechanical behaviour, the deployment and degradation, the fluid dynamics in the micro- and macroscale, and the myocardial perfusion, for predicting its interaction with the vascular wall in the short- and medium/long term. InSilc goes beyond the design and development of ISCT and lays on the generation of in-silico models for obtaining quick and informed answers to several “What if” scenarios. “Virtual” patients would be given a “virtual” drug-eluting BVS, for observing the performance of the scaffold, assess and quantify the intended effect, with a deeper understanding than normal trials can provide. By integrating the information obtained from different in-silico predictive models, InSilc will: (i) assist in the development, assessment and optimization of the drug-eluting BVS and deliver accurate and reliable information to the Stent Biomedical Industry, (ii) assist the interventional Cardiologists in improving the surgical process of drug-eluting BVS implantation, support them in the clinical assessment and reduce the complications of suboptimal scaffold performance. By introducing computer simulations for establishing the safety and efficacy of drug-eluting BVS, InSilc aims to lower development costs and shorten time-to-market, reduce, refine, and partially replace human clinical trials through a more effective human clinical trials design, reduce the need for animal testing and result in a significant reduction of the associated direct and indirect costs.",5839656.25,5839656.25,H2020-SC1-2017-CNECT-2,RIA,FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY HELLAS,EL,"ISTRAZIVACKO RAZVOJNI CENTAR ZA BIOINZENJERING BIOIRC DOO;NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND GALWAY;THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC LIMITED;FEOPS NV;UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS;CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE;POLITECNICO DI MILANO;PANEPISTIMIO IOANNINON;ERASMUS UNIVERSITAIR MEDISCH CENTRUM ROTTERDAM;CBSET, INC;MEDIOLANUM CARDIO RESEARCH SRL",RS;IE;UK;BE;IT;EL;NL;US,NA

Traditional forest inventories characterize forests from the ecologic and dasometric perspective; but they are expensive and typically planned on a 5-10years basis. This periodicity is often much lower than required for planning forests´ commercial or recreational activities on the basis of these data. Forest change rates demand tools able to monitor, on annual basis, the forest extension, the attributes of available timber, or the different ecosystem services emerged. 
MySustainableForest aims to develop a pre-commercial service and platform for forest stakeholders, compliant with open and standard interfaces, to integrate Earth Observation into the forest stakeholders’ decision making processes and operations. It will be implemented on the basis of GMV prototyped service, eoForest and will leverage on partners’ expertise on LiDAR and forest modelling.

However, despite of the remarkable reliability of current procedures, the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident highlighted a number of challenging issues with respect to their application and validity of their results. From this nuclear disaster the upgrading of the current methodological framework appeared to be necessary in areas such as cascading/conjunct events characterization, fragility analyses and uncertainties treatment. New developments in those areas would even enable the extension of their use in accident management.
Based on recent theoretical progresses, the NARSIS project aims at making significant scientific updates of some elements required for the PSA, focusing on external natural events (earthquake, tsunami, flooding, high speed winds...). These improvements mainly concern: 
• Natural hazards characterization, considering concomitant external (simultaneous-yet-independent or cascading) events, and the correlation in intra-event intensity parameters; 
• Fragility and functionality assessment of main critical NPPs' elements, accounting for conjunct effects (including ageing effects) and interdependencies under single or multiple external aggressions;
• Risk integration combined with uncertainty characterization and quantification, to allow efficient risks comparison and account for all possible interactions and cascade effects; 
• Better processing/integration of expert-based information within PSA, through modern uncertainty theories both to represent in flexible manner experts’ judgments and to aggregate them to be used in a comprehensive manner.

This is achieved via: a true multi-actor approach that balances environmental, economic- and social-securities by minimising environmental impact; optimising diversity and resilience in commercial and environmental terms throughout the supply chain; and delivery of excellent nutrition to ensure the highest possible states of health and wellbeing for people and animals. TRUE will achieve this using a series of 15 farm networks and 7 supply chain focused innovation Case Studies to characterise key mechanisms and associated ecosystem services indicators. This will empower the production of popular and novel legume-based products on the basis of improved market perspectives and capabilities, including short supply chains. Advanced mathematical approaches using Life Cycle Analysis, and socioeconomic and multi-attribute modelling will create unique Decision Support Tools to identify optimal transition paths to ensure legume supported systems are profitable from ‘the push’, of production, to ‘the pull’ of upstream supply chains, markets and consumers. Critically, the TRUE approach will also advise and empower policy amendments that promote uptake of new farming, processing, manufacturing and retailing practices, in line with the societal considerations of the Responsible Research and Innovation model: policy decision making with state-of-the-art science-based information.

A major difficulty in understanding high-Tc systems lies in the complexity of the materials and phase diagram. The delicate balance between material specific properties, disorder and the number of electronic phases superimpose makes it hard to identify the leading interactions. Consequently, theoretical models attempting to describe the high-Tc SC are significantly disparate and identifying the mechanism of SC at elevated temperatures is full of hardship.
Due to the proximity of the antiferromagnetic phase, the strong electronic interactions, the appearance of a pseudogap etc., the electronic phase is considered to be exotic, a non-Fermi Liquid and the coupling mechanism for Cooper pairs strange. Based on my recent experiments, here I propose a change of paradigm:
•that the charge carriers which couple to give high temperature superconductivity follow the well-known Fermi-liquid behavior
•that the pseudogap phenomenon corresponds to a gradual (Mott-like) localization of exactly ONE charge carrier per unit cell
•the “Glue” for pairing stems from a bosonic excitation of ONE localized carrier leading to a novel excitonic mechanism for SC.
These hypotheses will be tested primarily on the model compound Hg1201, which features a simple tetragonal structure, minimal disorder effects, and the highest Tc in its class of single-layer compounds. Fermi-liquid aspects will be probed by novel approaches to (magneto)transport, optical conductivity. The relation between SC and The ONE will be explored by unique experimental setups that combine uniaxial-pressure with local/structural probes.
If the above conjectures are indeed confirmed it would give an enormous boost to this field. Beyond finding the solution of a 30-year-old enigma, it would enable an educated search for new materials with potentially even higher Tc's.",2133950,2133950,ERC-2016-COG,ERC-COG,TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET WIEN,AT,FACULTY OF SCIENCE UNIVERSITY OF ZAGREB,HR,NA

The European ATM Master Plan Edition 2015 approved by the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) Administrative Board and the European Commission and recently published, sets out Performance Ambitions and a Vision for European ATM, in full alignment with ICAO Global Air Navigation Plan.

The ATM MP is composed of three Levels; it can be consulted in the ATM MP Public Portal www.atmmasterplan.eu.

By EU Regulation 409/2013, the ATM MP is the essential instrument allowing all European ATM key civil and military stakeholders - Airspace users, Air Navigation Service providers, Airports, Network Manager, Airborne and Ground industry, Standardisation bodies and Professional Staff organisations - to share and further develop this common vision for the future European ATM and setting forth the SESAR solutions which following successful research are likely to be elicited to compose future Common Projects for operationally seamless and cost effective deployment.

The ATM MP needs to be a living plan, kept abreast of evolutions of the European ATM performance, progresses of the SESAR solutions research results and of deployment.  The duty of SESAR PJ20 AMPLE (ATM Master PLan for Europe) is to ensure the maintenance, update and alignment of the ATM MP three Levels and its associated Portal as a Common Support Activity of the SESAR 2020 Programme.

It proposes the development of a remotely provided aerodrome air traffic service by a 'multiple' and/or 'center' setting. Those settings help to combine ATS services from various aerodromes in a centralized control room  independent on airport location in order to make use of the valuable resource ATS provider more efficiently. “Single” remote tower settings have already been deployed in former project, but most significant impacts in cost-effectiveness are to be expected with multiple and/or center settings that was only partly covered so far and needs immediate development effort to deploy it short term. PJ05 will bring the multiple/center concept to a higher matured level. In the end, the passengers will benefit from: More cost-effective aerodrome ATS would allow rural, less frequented airports to work cost-effective and to keep them in operations or even to increase the service levels for more day hours operations or even to upgrade non-controlled to controlled airports. All this would contribute to a better passenger comfort in terms of shorter travel times and better point to point connections.
The PJ05 aim attracted plenty of European organisations to participate: ANSPs, industries, R&D and airport stakeholder intends to provide their specific competences to broaden the operational needs and technological expertises. The PJ05 variety of partners and validation activities will help to adequately reflect the variety of operational needs and technical solutions which in the end of the project will consolidate into a harmonized and widely accepted SESAR2020 PJ05 solution. The complete work is structured in a very collaborative way throughout all work packages and will ensure the transfer of knowledge and know-how between all participants and external to SESAR2020 projects.

It will achieve this by:
• Coordinating the monitoring, verification and enforcement activities of 13 Market Surveillance Authorities (MSAs) across the Single Market  and Turkey;
• Improving the effectiveness of the MSAs through skills-building training, the provision of guidelines and the promotion of Best Practices.
MSTyr15 will enhance the functioning of the European Single Market by ensuring that the tyres regulatory measures are effectively enforced across MS. It will deliver energy savings >105 GWh/year through removing incorrectly labelled tyres from the market.
Experience and resources for enforcement have been very limited in many MS since the tyres regulations were introduced in 2009. MSTyr15 includes mechanisms for assisting the skills development of less experienced staff and their authorities, supporting the adoption of common best practices and providing budgets to cover the high costs of testing tyres to the required standards.
It will coordinate market surveillance actions involving checks on in excess of 15,000 tyres. It will deliver a higher level of surveillance activities that go beyond testing. The consortium will work closely with other non-participating MSAs across the EEA though its liaison with the Tyres ADCO. Additionally, the MSTyr15 consortium will work together with an Advisory Board comprising of supply-side business, consumer organisations and environmental NGOs. 
The expected results are: 
- Adoption of best practices;
- Market surveillance being undertaken in a more cost effective and consistent manner;

Main objective of INTMET is applying on-site mine-to-metal hydroprocessing of the produced concentrates enhancing substantially raw materials efficiency thanks to increase Cu\Zn\Pb recovery over 60% vs. existing selective flotation. 3 innovative hydrometallurgical processes (atmospheric, pressure and bioleaching), and novel more effective metals extraction techniques (e.g. Cu/Zn-SX-EW, chloride media, MSA, etc) will be developed and tested at relevant environment aiming to maximise metal recovery yield and minimising energy consumption and environmental footprint. Additionally secondary materials like tailings and metallurgical wastes will be tested as well for metals recovery and sulphur valorisation. The technical, environmental and economic feasibility of the entire approaches will be evaluated to ensure a real business solution of the integrated INTMET process.
INTMET will be economically viable thanks to diversification of products (Cu, Zn, Pb), high-profitable solution (producing commodities not concentrates), with lower operation and environmental costs (on-site hydroprocessing will avoid transport to smelters) and allowing mine-life extension developing a new business-model concept based on high efficient recovery of complex ores that will ensure EU mining industry competitiveness and employment.

The project exploits location-specific advantages that arise from two crucial facts. Firstly, there is large number of archaeological sites and remains in Croatia that are relatively understudied. Secondly there is a group of researchers (CrEAMA Initiative) whose research capacity, impact, and grant success at the European level has not realised full potential owing to a relative lack of resources, coordination, and strategic planning. This project will unlock this latent scientific potential by developing multi-inter-trans- disciplinary (MIT disciplinary) expertise. Our ultimate vision is to develop a research group capable of using an MIT disciplinary approach to Sciences of the Past; this will be a powerful force for innovation and will contribute to resolving contemporary issues. This vision will be realised through support from our partners: the UCAM and the UP. Both institutions display success in Archaeology, Genetics and other Sciences of the Past, and have proven track records in applying for and completing EU-funded research projects. The first goal is to establish and integrate the existing MIT disciplinary scientific research community in Croatia. The second goal is to upgrade and intensify scientific research of CrEAMA Initiative by utilising recent methodological achievements in genetics (NGS) and other biological disciplines (GMM).

More specifically, the project has the following objectives:
• develop system components allowing reduced costs, increased durability and efficiency 
• build and validate a first 50 kW PEM prototype CHP system 
• create the required value chain from automotive manufacturers to stationary energy end-users
Mass-market production of fuel cells will be a strong factor in reducing first costs. In this respect, joining the forces of two non-competing sectors (automotive and stationary) will bring benefits to both, to increase production volume and ultimately reduce costs to make fuel cells competitive. As a consequence, the project partners have identified a PEM fuel cell based CHP concept to address the stationary power market, primarily for commercial and industrial buildings requiring an installed capacity from about 50 kWe to some hundreds of kWe. The main components of the system have been validated to at least laboratory scale (TRL>4).   As a part of the present AutoRE proposal, the overall system will be demonstrated and further validated to increase the technology readiness level to TRL5. In addition, innovative solutions will be demonstrated to continuously improve performance and reduce costs and complexity. The project consortium reflects the full value chain of the fuel cell CHP system which will enhance significantly the route to market for the system/technology.  

The proposal relates to FCH-02.5-2014: Innovative fuel cell systems at intermediate power range for distributed combined heat and power generation, and it addresses the main specific challenges and scope laid down in the FCH JU AWP2014 to “develop, manufacturing and validation of a new generation of fuel cell systems with properties that significantly improve competitiveness'.'",4464447.25,3496947,H2020-JTI-FCH-2014-1,FCH2-RIA,ALSTOM POWER LTD,UK,"SVEUCILISTE U SPLITU, FAKULTET ELEKTROTEHNIKE, STROJARSTVA I BRODOGRADNJE;ELVIO ANONYMI ETAIREIA SYSTIMATON PARAGOGIS YDROGONOU KAI ENERGEIAS;STIFTELSEN SINTEF;GENERAL ELECTRIC (SWITZERLAND) GMBH;NUCELLSYS GMBH;DAIMLER AG;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DELLA TUSCIA",HR;EL;NO;CH;DE;IT,NA

Innovative solutions have to be implemented upon properly understanding the main energy consuming factors and trends, as well as properly modeling and understanding the citizens’ behaviour and the potential for lifestyle changes. 
The ENTROPY project addresses this challenge by building upon the integration of technologies that facilitate the deployment of innovative energy aware IT ecosystems for motivating end-users’ behavioural changes and namely: (1) the Internet of Things that provides the capacity for interconnecting numerous devices and applying energy-efficient communication protocols, (2) the evolvement of advanced Data Modelling and Analysis techniques that support the realization of semantic models and knowledge extraction mechanisms and (3) the Recommendation and Gamification eras that can trigger interaction with relevant users in social networks, increase end users’ awareness with regards to ways to achieve energy consumption savings in their daily activities and adopt energy efficient lifestyles as well as provide a set of energy efficient recommendations and motives. 
Novel practices that fully integrate information collected from a set of sensor networks and mobile crowd sensing activities are going to be exploited along with processes for monitoring, reporting and analysing sets of data with regards to energy consumption and the behavioural profile of citizens.

With a focus on European start-ups and young SMEs, the project aims at triggering action by young entrepreneurs and their emerging enterprises as well as by the owners and staff of young SMEs to introduce energy efficiency measures within their daily routines.

Even though each start-up and SME consumes relatively small energy amounts, the collective environmental impact of 20 million SMEs in the EU is massive, contributing to 64% of environmental impact. Active engagement of start-ups and young SMEs is essential in order to reach the 20-20-20 EU goals and there is market potential for almost all enterprises to cost effectively reduce their energy consumption. START2ACT will unleash the potential of energy savings at European start-ups and young SMEs via a set of innovative educational and capacity building measures.

A key area of intervention to increase energy efficiency through behavioural change is office equipment, the fastest growing energy user in the business world, consuming 15% of the total electricity used in offices, which is expected to rise to 30% by 2020. START2ACT aims to trigger the use and uptake of the many available tools and solutions offering a great potential for energy and money savings, yet not adequately used due to lack of understanding of how to use them in practice and due to insufficient engagement of people towards changing behaviour in everyday life.

Objective of EnPC-INTRANS is to increase the market uptake of technologies for the improvement of energy efficiency (EE) in public buildings and services by means of fostering private sector participation in innovative financing schemes for EE investments. This will be achieved by means of implementing large-scale capacity building for local public authorities and SMEs to jointly set-up and use adapted EnPC models for EE services (topic 3 in the scope of the EE21 call). 
European best practices in EnPC are adapted to local conditions (WP2) and presented to relevant target groups in the partner countries (WP3). Training needs of local public authorities and SMEs are assessed in intensive stakeholder dialogue, providing the basis for design and implementation of efficient training concepts and tools making use of advanced on-line technologies for European-wide capacity development (WP3). Trainers are trained throughout the partners’ networks (WP4) and the developed training concepts and tools are demonstrated in national and international cooperation seminars (WP5). The achieved impact of large-scale capacity development on the European market for EnPC projects is continuously monitored and evaluated (WP6), and the project results are disseminated to all EU28 member states (WP7).
At least 50 trained trainers and 3,000 trained experts will directly benefit from the project and cater for the initiation and development of EnPC projects in partner countries and beyond, providing for energy savings of more than 60 GWh per year when implemented. (The lead Partner) GIZ has been commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) with the implementation of the project ‘Energy Efficiency in Municipalities’ in the Ukraine.

This means that sufficient access is required to explore and exploit minerals. At the same time the mineral needs of our society must be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Accordingly exploitable mineral deposits (known deposits, abandoned mines and historical mining sites) need to be assessed against other land uses, taking into account criteria such as habitats, other environmental concerns, priorities for settlements, etc. Access to mineral deposits, on the other hand, also meets public interests such as raw materials security (compared with many international access options). The deliberation between these diverse land uses requires adequate consideration of the exclusiveness, reversibility, and consequences on the surrounding.

Funding schemes are successful (or not) depending on the Business Model that generates them. The performance of the Business Model is affected by the implementation context and the transport mode. It is matched successfully (or not) by a financing scheme. Relations between actors are described by a governance model (contracting arrangements). These are key elements in Transport Infrastructure Provision, Operation and Maintenance. Success is a measure of the appropriate matching of elements. Within BENEFIT funding and financing schemes are analysed in this respect. Describing these key elements through their characteristics and attributes and clustering each of them is the basis of, first, developing a generic framework. This allows for the transferability of findings with respect to “lessons learned”, “limitations” and “the impact of the financial and economic crisis”. Identifying best matches in their inter-relations and where to intervene, leads to move from a generic framework to a powerful decision policy tool, which can assess funding schemes for investments in modern infrastructure with smart pricing and funding in view of 2050 challenges and needs.

These savings will ultimately benefit airlines and their customers. It achieves this by delivering the ATM Master Plan goals (defined by the European Air Traffic Management (ATM) community) for a more efficient deployment of human resources,  a progressive increase in automation support, the implementation of virtualisation technologies and  the use of standardised and interoperable systems whilst increasing the safety level. 

Within the PJ16 proposal, there are two innovative solutions:
The first solution develops a concept for separating the Controller Working Position (CWP) from the datacentre where the data is produced. This lean and efficient use of ANSP infrastructure tackles the issues presented by fragmented European ATM systems and country-specific architectures, enabling Europe to move to an interoperable, cost-effective and flexible service provision infrastructure. Decoupling of the CWPs should enable a more efficient use of the most valuable and expensive resource, the human. By enabling increased flexibility the ANSPs should better manage staffing for prevailing traffic conditions and assure service continuity. 

The second solution deals with new methods of controller interaction with the Human Machine Interface (HMI), applying mature technologies from other domains to ATM.

The process makes use of high pressure CO2 technology as drying medium which enables efficient drying at close-to-ambient temperatures in absence of oxygen. Research and development studies have shown it feasibility of being an ecological and economical alternative to freeze-drying, for products categories vegetables and fruits, specialty ingredients such as proteins and biopolymers. Besides good preservation of a food quality, microbial inactivation occurs in situ which attributes to ensuring food safety. 

The main objectives are: (i) minimize risks that could prevent CO2 drying to enter the market and (ii) to demonstrate its market replication potential via a first application to the market. 

The base of the project is to provide on the one hand prototyped products and on the other prototyped process extensions that will increase the market potential. Prototyping processing elements will demonstrate the energy reduction of the process and the full width of applications at a pilot scale. By preparing three product prototypes the aim is to demonstrate the full potential of this technology to the industry at a foodgrade level, resulting in validation of the process.

On the basis of the prototype assessments, in close conjunction with industrial (SME) parties, the process will be certified, (economically) validated and demonstrated to the industry. The final step is demonstrating the process in a near-operational environment to identify all the benefits for consumer and the food chain. 
By doing so, the drying process will evolve from a TRL 4-5 to a TRL 8. By intensive dissemination to increase visibility, the technology will disseminated to SME’s in Europe to maximize uptake of the technology in the market and realizating impact on sustainability, food safety and economy.",2602973.75,2094031.62,H2020-SFS-2014-2,IA,FEYECON DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION BV,NL,UNIVERSITEIT GENT;VNK B.V.;RISE RESEARCH INSTITUTES OF SWEDEN AB;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI PADOVA;FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE - UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE;CO2 DRY BV,BE;NL;SE;IT;RS,NA

However outcome of this diagnosis is today still poor. Moreover, current technology to measure biomarker levels is expensive and sophisticated.
Most cancer biomarker analysis use blood or biological tissues as the main source of material. These biopsies must be analyzed in specialized laboratories incurring in some limitations: high cost; specialized personnel and equipment; large amounts of biological material; long outcome delivery time; time consuming processes.
Therefore it exist a real need and urgency to have new diagnostic devices that provide diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring data faster and with exquisite ultra-sensitivity on time to take the appropriate decisions to improve personalized diagnosis and therapy.
The aim of GLAM project is to provide an innovative device to fulfill these requirements using soluble biomarkers for personalized diagnosis and therapy monitoring.
Specifically we will design and develop a new diagnostic tool to detect biomarkers from biofluids obtained in a non-invasive manner, specifically focusing to urine and to genitourinary cancers, to help oncologist to take better treatment decisions, approaching personalized medicine.
GLAM will develop an integrated device based on novel label-free photonic biosensors with ultra-sensitivity, simplicity of use, portability, multiplexing and low cost. GLAM capitalizes on the unprecedented sensitivity achieved using laser microring resonators to detect key biomarkers in tumor development and treatment.

As such, DEMOS explores the practical value of ’democratic efficacy’ as the condition of political engagement needed to address the challenge of populism. The concept combines attitudinal features (political efficacy), political skills, knowledge, and democratic opportunity structures.

In order to better understand populism DEMOS addresses its hitherto under-researched aspects at micro-, meso-, and macro-levels: its socio-psychological roots, social actors’ responses to the populist challenge, and populism’s effects on governance. DEMOS focuses not only on the polity, but equally on citizens’ perspectives: how they are affected by, and how they react to, populism. Politically underrepresented groups and those targeted by populist politics are a particular focus, e.g. youth, women, and migrants. As populism has varying socially embedded manifestations, DEMOS aims at contextualising it through comparative analysis on the variety of populisms across Europe, including their historical, cultural, and socioeconomic roots, manifestations, and impacts. DEMOS develops indicators and predictors of populism and elaborates scenarios on the interactions of populism with social actors and institutions both at the national and the EU levels.

Unifying 15 partners from 10 disciplines, DEMOS combines in-depth research on populism and democratic efficacy with action research and pilot projects in order to develop lasting tools and timely policy recommendations; project methods include experiments, deliberative polling, text mining, surveys, and legal analysis.

Buildings are scarcely isolated, often there are no heating systems in buildings, or those are highly inefficient, and the cooling component is more important than in other areas, calling for a diversity of energy services beyond heating. Women and women-led households are disproportionately affected by energy poverty, while women’s agency is highlighted in acting against energy poverty. Although there is some knowledge on the health impacts of energy poverty, involving health practitioners in the energy poverty action is rare.

This is why the main objective of the project is to contribute to energy poverty abatement in the Mediterranean through a) implementing a set of practical energy efficiency and RES measures, tailored to empower households in energy poverty and specifically focused on women and health, b) assessing their efficiency and impacts to formulate policy recommendations and c) promoting policy solutions among key actors for stimulating action against energy poverty at local and EU level.

The project will first build networks with local actors in pilot regions (WP1) and transfer knowledge and experience to build capacity of all involved actors for implementing practical measures (WP2). The core of the project is implementation of practical measures to tackle energy poverty, such as community approaches, household visits, do-it-yourself approaches, support for small investments and health workshops (WP3). The impacts and success of the implemented measures will be assessed and analysed (WP4) to support formulation of policy recommendations, which will be advocated among key actors to stimulate and support policies against energy poverty (WP5).

In order to achieve this goal, society as a whole has to become more accountable and mutual responsibility needs to be distributed amongst all actors. Therefore, urban governance schemes need to become more transparent and inclusive so that all can benefit. This is why public administrations need to be equipped with skills and support schemes. Local transition roadmaps draw on the required skills and capacities of local authorities and allow them to become leaders of the energy transition. Such roadmaps provide explicit strategies and operational tools for local governments to address the multiple challenges of the energy transition and their ecological, economic, and social aspects. Thereby, their development provides both, space for innovations to develop, and participatory approaches to flourish.

HVAC professionals play an important role in energy efficiency, especially in renovation where HVAC systems are often replaced or upgraded first. 
The proposed training schemes are based on CEN standards related to the EPBD and mandated by the European Commission. The standards were voted positively in January 2017. The new CEN standards offer innovative approaches and solutions including renewables, economical calculation (cost optimum) and measured energy . 
To bring them into application, training is urgently needed. Several national calculation methodologies for energy performance of buildings are based on current CEN standards and they have to be replaced by new standards. 
The proposal is focusing  on increased skills of HVAC professionals with direct links to the EPBD and Ecodesign Directive (e.g. Lot1, Lot 2). CEN standards are also used for the common EU voluntary certification scheme requested in the EPBD. 
The training scheme will be complemented by a qualification scheme. 
It addresses strong market request, shown by the support of stakeholders of the whole building value chain.   
Qualification and training based on European standards is an advantage for mutual recognition of qualifications and certifications schemes among different EU Member States. Standardisation is also key to create level playing field conditions for products European wide.     
The consortium includes standard writers, HVAC professional association and professionals, public authority advisers, universities and is supported by actors of the whole building value chain.",824883.92,824883.92,H2020-EE-2017-CSA-PPI,CSA,CENTRE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE DU BATIMENT,FR,"SOCAL LAURENT;ENBEE SRO;FEDERATIE VAN VERENIGINGEN VOOR VERWARMING EN LUCHTBEHANDELING IN EUROPA VERENIGING;SVEUCILISTE U ZAGREBU, FAKULTET STROJARSTVA I BRODOGRADNJE",IT;SK;NL;HR,NA

The Alliance represents a remedial action, which builds on outcomes of the previously performed initiatives analyzing health R&I barriers and enabling factors as proposed by e.g. DanuBalt and RegHealth-RI projects. Alliance4Life consortium will concentrate efforts on both (1) mutual learning and sharing practical experience, and (2) receiving motivating feedback from high performing research institutions. We will establish Focus Groups, open platforms for idea generation and exchange of knowledge, working within eight domains of expertise: science evaluation, HR and recruitment, research funding, core facilities and big data, technology transfer, bio-ethics, science communication, and mobility. In all the domains of expertise, the formation of Alliance4Life enables experience-driven approach focused on best practice cases realized by its members, avoiding actions that failed in the past and promoting those that demonstrated high impact at reasonable cost. The learning process will contribute to institutional reforms in research management and support increased participation in international consortia. The Alliance will develop progressive strategies including suggestions for exploitation of the potential provided by synergies between ESIF and H2020, which will be coordinated with the health R&I managing authorities of the particular less performing countries.

In order to democratically boost the competitiveness of the European manufacturers (especially Small and Medium-sized Enterprises - SMEs), innovative solutions need to consider technological and commercial scalability from the beginning. From this perspective, the cloudification of services has become the ideal enabler in the manufacturing digitalization. Successful European initiatives such us CloudFlow, cloudSME or Fortissimo have demonstrated the benefits of cloudification for engineering services, by means of combining HPC resources, computational tools, and cloud computing platforms. Manufacturing SMEs are empowered to compute and solve problems that cannot be tackled without cloud and HPC technology, making them more competitive by reducing development times for innovative product with better performance. The results of these initiatives are fostering the engineering and to some extend the prototyping processes within the manufacturing workflow; however, monitoring and optimizing production processes have not yet greatly benefited from an integrated information workflow and simulation loop based on on-line factory data. 
The core partners of CloudFlow (eu-cloudflow.eu) and cloudSME (cloudsme.eu) are joining forces to leverage factory data with cloud-based engineering tools: 
a) paving the way toward manufacturing analytics, 
b) enriching the manufacturing engineering process with on-line data, and

In OPTIMISC also a large number of genotypes were screened for various stress tolerances (e.g. frost, drought, salinity) which are key traits for good performance under marginal conditions. However, both projects worked on small trial plots and identified utilization options only at lab scale. Miscanthus or hemp varieties that are specifically suitable for marginal lands are not yet available. A major bottleneck for development of such varieties is the lack of information on their large scale performance. Therefore the next step to develop these biomass crops for the growing bioeconomy is to demonstrate the feasibility of upscaling their production. Cultivars also need to meet the quality requirements of the specific end uses. Based on knowledge gained by the projects OPTIMISC and MultiHemp, the biomass composition of the germplasm is largely known and can be matched to the specific end uses. However, the upscaling of these value chains with tailored germplasm is not yet proven and represents a bottle neck for their wider application. The objective of this project is to demonstrate 1) the upscaling of crop production of miscanthus and hemp genotypes matched to end use and 2) their suitability for marginal, contaminated and unused land. Another aim of the project is to demonstrate the upscaling of the most promising biomass valorization chains with tailored genotypes. Various valorization options will be tested by associated partners (industry panel) and a subset will be demonstrated at (pre)commercial scale.

TARGET takes a reflexive approach which goes beyond the formal adoption of a gender equality plan by emphasising an iterative reflection of progress made as well as establishing a community of practice to effect institutional transformation. Actual change is the result of increased institutional willingness and capacity to identify, reflect on and address gender bias in a sustained way. Starting point and anchor of the process is a tailored Gender Equality Plan or Strategy (GEP/GES) in each GEII. TARGET will build the institutional capacity for a reflexive gender equality policy by: developing effective tools for each stage of the GEP/GES (audit, planning, implementation, monitoring, self-assessment) to be customised to the specific institution; supporting the development of competences to conduct a gender audit, to design, implement, monitor and self-assess a tailored GEP/GES; establishing a community of practice of relevant stakeholders within each GEII; initiating an organisational learning process within each GEII which combines self-assessment with GEP/GES evaluation. The TARGET countries have been characterised as relatively inactive in developing gender equality policies in R&I. To ensure that action taken has a multiplier effect, each GEII will undertake targeted dissemination activities to initiate a national/regional discourse on gender equality in R&I.

This will be achieved by:

•	The Safety framework will incorporate remote monitoring data stored in a BIM model that feeds into a decision support framework (DST) that enables decisions to be made automatically with maintenance prioritised for elements exhibiting stress.
•	A major advance that will be achieved in the project is that the algorithms at an object level and at a network level will incorporate machine learning to train the system to evolve with time using available monitoring data. 
•	A trans-disciplinary approach with experts in Artificial Intelligence and big data management working with owners, engineers with expertise in risk and modelling and sociologists  to make decisions.
•	Our major European infrastructure managers (Rijkswaterstaat for roads and inland waterways and Network Rail) will undertake demonstration projects at critical interchanges and nodes of the TEN-T transport network.

It does this through integrating research, policy and practice objectives in a three stage process of: 1) critical review of existing knowledge, policy and interventions in radicalisation and counter-radicalisation; 2) generation of new empirical research on young people’s encounters with, and responses to, messages and agents of radicalisation; and 3) integration of research findings to develop, pilot and evaluate two educational toolkits and a de-radicalisation programme evaluation tool to enhance the effectiveness of counter-radicalisation interventions. 
Through its focus on Islamist and anti-Islam(ist) radicalisation DARE addresses both ‘religious fundamentalism’ and ‘violence and hate crime’ dimensions of the topic call and explores how radicalisation processes interact to produce cumulative effects. It takes as its focus young people as a group that is targeted by recruiters and conventionally understood to be receptive to radicalism. It also places emphasis on gender dimensions of radicalisation.
DARE recognises that improving knowledge on radicalisation has urgent implications for societal security but contributes to the wider objectives of the ‘Reversing inequalities and promoting fairness’ call through recognising that social inequality and discrimination give rise to perceived injustice which may motivate engagement with radical ideologies and actions. DARE’s primary concern is to address the long term social roots and effects of radicalisation and to engage young people themselves in countering radicalisation through its, innovative, attention to non-radicalisation alongside radicalisation trajectories.

The ENABLE.EU project will aim to define the key determinants of individual and collective energy choices in three key consumption areas - transportation, heating & cooling, and electricity – and in the shift to prosumption (users-led initiatives of decentralised energy production and trade). The project will also investigate the interrelations between individual and collective energy choices and their impact on regulatory, technological and investment decisions. The analysis will be based on national household and business surveys in 11 countries, as well as research-area-based comparative case studies. ENABLE.EU aims to also strengthen the knowledge base for energy transition patterns by analysing existing public participation mechanisms, energy cultures, social mobilisation, scientists’ engagement with citizens. Gender issues and concerns regarding energy vulnerability and affluence will be given particular attention. The project will also develop participatory-driven scenarios for the development of energy choices until 2050 by including the findings from the comparative sociological research in the E3ME model created by Cambridge Econometrics and used extensively by DG Energy.

In Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (ATFCM), the performance targets and expectations at the network and local level could to be better achieved only through a collaborative synchronised effort of all the involved actors.
An important part of improving the performance of network operations is the effective and efficient planning of network resources, by linking local optimization processes (including airport processes) with network optimization processes, taking into account stakeholders’ preferences where possible. This facilitates also the innovative usage and application of fine-tuned tailored measures (including target times) to further enhance of performance.
NCM is divided into four main focus areas:
• Network perspective (with local input and support): Scenario Management (including Hotspot Awareness)
• Local perspective (facilitated by network support): Tactical Capacity Management 
• Airspace User Preferences: feeding both local and network perspectives 
• Local-network integration: Airport Network Integration.
NM can act as a reliable, dynamic and flexible binder between the building elements (ANSPs, Airports and AUs) of the new improved and highly interactive ATM system, where each element brings its own unique sine qua non contribution to the robustness of the entire structure.
NCM is a trust building exercise designed to demonstrate the maturity of the integrated network and local concept elements including the interactions between all ATM actors.

The positive impact on the adoption of Smart Farming Technologies (SFT) in crop farming has been well established for the last 10 years. In fact, many SFT are available at present time, but farmers find it difficult to grasp which are the technologies that can be used and furthermore, which are the productivity and environmental benefits brought by their adoption. Likewise, SFT companies face barriers in the commercialization of their equipment due to the lack of knowledge and training of the farmer community.

The GIFT project suggests creating meaningful personalization through digital gifting and emotional appropriation: Designs for allowing visitors to create their own museum tours as digital 'mixtapes', and to play with technologies that measure emotional responses to artwork as a playful reappropriation of museum spaces.

We aim to accommodate the complex ways in which users may confront art and heritage content, and engage users to participate and share experiences that are emotionally poignant and personally profound. Through multidisciplinary, practice-based research we will develop, test and validate two ground-breaking prototypes for digital encounters with cultural heritage. From this process we will develop a framework with theory, tools, design guidelines and best practice recommendations for creating meaningful personalization of hybrid virtual museum experiences.

The GIFT consortium includes leading artists and researchers with a long history of successful collaborations, who will be working with a panel of 10 lead users from prominent European museums, to develop theoretical and practical advances with great impact for the cultural heritage sector and European society.

By enabling more engaging hybrid virtual/physical museum experiences, we will contribute to increasing citizens' curiosity and engagement. The hybrid format will also help make both virtual museum experiences as well as physical visits more engaging and attractive, thus contributing to economic growth through ticket sales as well as digital sales. By providing frameworks that help non-technical experts in the heritage sector to build and experiment with meaningful personalization of digital cultural heritage, the project gives the sector tools to build and innovate further.

1. Produce a culture shift in terms of environment for SUMPs in member states and in the organisational culture of transport planning in city authorities.
2. Get ministries and national agencies to play a national leading role on SUMPs, as in many member states these are the organisations from which cities take their main direction; where ministries are already playing this role, to support and strengthen their approach.
3. To provide mechanisms and tools for Ministries to take this lead role.
4. Analyse clearly the problems of (lack of) take-up of SUMPs – to understand from cities themselves why they are not taken up and then to help cities to address these barriers.
5. Extend the existing 25-county EU-SUMP-network with at least two more countries
6. Get more cities to take up effective high quality SUMPs – through cities’ involvement in the project and indirectly through more cities hearing about SUMPs in their country.
7. Ensure that these SUMPs contain and will lead to implementation of a broad range of innovative sustainable transport measures.
8. Build cities’ capacity to develop and implement SUMPs that genuinely reflect the spirit of the EU SUMP Guidelines, rather than being mandatory documents to fulfil a requirement linked to major transport infrastructure.
9. Deliver a measurable impact.
 
The core concept of PROSPERITY is bringing ministries into the project, which will significantly enhance the visibility of the project at the national level and therefore increase numbers of cities active on SUMPs. Thus PROSPERITY will ensure that more cities commit to SUMPs that are in line with the EU SUMP Guidelines and that include a broad range of innovative measures.

Since 2009 JPND has been operating on a very light management structure based on a simple Terms of Reference. Through this JPND has been able to set a common Strategic Research Agenda, and to deliver its first implementation plan that has allowed among other achievements, the mobilisation of approximately €100 million of additional funding between 2011 and 2015 to support transnational research programs. While progress has been pleasing to date, the implementation of JPND must now be scaled-up to further catalyse Member State commitments, and to formalize synergies between members and various partners. The immediate challenge therefore for JPND is to secure its long-term sustainability by Member States, to mobilize those which are not yet participating, and to increase its impact at the national level and globally. JPsustaiND thus aims at creating the dedicated structure responsible for long-term JPND management and implementation, and extension of JPND membership to EU Member States and other countries and initiatives not yet participating. To achieve this goal, the JPsustaiND partners, with the support of the JPND Management Board, will implement the following six workpackages: Coordination and Management; Long Term Sustainability; Capacity Extension; Alignment and Outreach; Communication and Advocacy; and Monitoring, Evaluation and Impact Assessment. JPsustaiND will implement a stronger global dimension of the JPND, and will avoid duplication of research and infrastructure investment at the national level.

Objectives:
• Rigorously and systematically develop practical definitions of urban road congestion and of network performance, and identify factors influencing conditions in different cities.
• Work with Western European (WE) cities that have succeeded in decoupling traffic growth from economic growth, to analyse quantitatively the objective factors which have contributed to this, and the qualitative factors which have enabled a policy evolution from ‘supporting traffic growth’ to ‘encouraging sustainable mobility’.
• Develop concrete guidance and provide capacity building for cities in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and the EuroMed region, enabling them to move rapidly to develop a feasible, effective and deliverable Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP). 
• Anticipating future pressures on city transport systems (congestion and overcrowding), to investigate how new transport technologies might increase transport efficiency, and how non-transport technologies and changes in business and social practices could reduce pressures on transport systems.
These objectives will be achieved by:
• Analysing congestion and network performance data provided by INRIX and WE cities.
• Using detailed household travel data from repeat surveys in WE cities since the 1970s/1980s and complementary data on network, economic and demographic conditions; and documents setting out historical policy development.
• Preparing detailed guidance and training for our CEE cities, which will then be delivered to a much larger set of cities.

However, European development in this priority field is failing to keep pace with demand due to a lack of qualified personnel, a lack of cohesion and integration among stakeholders, and poorly developed links between professional training and the real needs of industry. Based on seven work packages the Phoenix RISE project will address these issues by exploiting the complementary expertise of its partners and creating synergies between them through the targeted secondments of staff to advance research and innovation knowledge in bio-energy research. Phoenix is an international, interdisciplinary, cross-sectorial project, bringing together a total of 16 partners: 14 from the EU (5 companies and 9 academic organisations) and two Third-Country academic partners to enhance its collective research excellence and create new, post-graduate-level research training in key disciplines that support the provision of bio-energy.",1377000,1377000,H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015,MSCA-RISE,"EUROPEAN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY INNOVATION ALLIANCE - ESEIA, VEREIN FUR FORDERUNG DER EUROPAIESCHEN INNOVATION FUR ERNEUERBARE ENERGIEN",AT,"UNIVERSITE DE LIEGE;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAET GRAZ;INSTITUT POLYTECHNIQUE DE GRENOBLE;UNIVERSITEIT TWENTE;Laboratorio Nacional de Energia e Geologia I.P.;UNIVERSITY OF ZAGREB - FACULTY OF FOOD TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY - UZAG PBF;TORRES & BELO SA;BERGISCHER ABFALLWIRTSCHAFTSVERBAND;ASOCIATIA GREEN ENERGY;ENERGIE AGENTUR STEIERMARK GEMEINNUTZIGE GMBH;BRP-POWERTRAIN GMBH & CO KG;SVEUCILISTE U ZAGREBU, FAKULTET STROJARSTVA I BRODOGRADNJE;LAPPEENRANNAN-LAHDEN TEKNILLINEN YLIOPISTO LUT",BE;AT;FR;NL;PT;HR;DE;RO;FI,NA

Its disruptive approach will involve many interrelated mechanisms at various architectural levels, including heterogeneous computing cores, memory architectures, interconnects, run-time resource management, power monitoring and cooling, to the programming models. The system architecture will be inherently heterogeneous as an enabler for efficiency and application-based customization, where general-purpose compute nodes (GN) are intertwined with heterogeneous acceleration nodes (HN), linked by an across-boundary homogeneous interconnect. It will provide guarantees for predictability, bandwidth and latency for the whole HN node infrastructure, allowing dynamic adaptation to applications. MANGO will develop a toolset for PPP and explore holistic pro-active thermal and power management for energy optimization including chip, board and rack cooling levels, creating a hitherto inexistent link between HW and SW effects at all layers. Project will build an effective large-scale emulation platform. The architecture will be validated through noticeable examples of application with QoS and high-performance requirements.

Ultimately, the combined interplay of the multi-level innovative solutions brought by MANGO will result in a new positioning in the PPP space, ensuring sustainable performance as high as 100 PFLOPS for the realistic levels of power consumption (<15MWatt) delivered to QoS-sensitive applications in large-scale capacity computing scenarios providing essential building blocks at the architectural level enabling the full realization of the ETP4HPC strategic research agenda",5801820,5801820,H2020-FETHPC-2014,RIA,UNIVERSITAT POLITECNICA DE VALENCIA,ES,THALES SIX GTS FRANCE SAS;Centro Regionale Information Communication Technology scrl;SVEUCILISTE U ZAGREBU FAKULTET ELEKTROTEHNIKE I RACUNARSTVA;ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FEDERALE DE LAUSANNE;PRO DESIGN Electronic GmbH;POLITECNICO DI MILANO;EATON INDUSTRIES (FRANCE) SAS;PHILIPS MEDICAL SYSTEMS NEDERLAND BV,FR;IT;HR;CH;DE;NL,NA

NSCLC alone make up about 75% of all lung cancers and most hospitals currently test all NSCLC patients for EGFR mutations (pharmacogenomics) for treatment decision (personalised medicine) – i.e., patients with mutation(s) in EGFR gene should receive a EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) drug (e.g. afitinib) treatment; while those that do not present mutations in such gene, should be treated with chemotherapy. Currently, the laboratories use PCR and Sanger sequencing technologies to perform the EGFR analysis from tumour biopsies - Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) samples. Still, some patients (e.g., 30% in UK) may never get histological confirmation because they are too sick to make a biopsy. Furthermore, the results obtained with current methods still present low quality, mainly due to poor quality/low yield of DNA extracted from FFPE samples. The FP7 LungCARD project (www.lungcard.eu) has developed and demonstrated a LungCARD system - an automatic system composed by microfluidic chip and chip analyser - that allows to capture circulating tumour cells (CTCs) from blood samples, amplify by multiplex PCR and detect EGFR mutations, including also a software for data analysis and report. Although this new blood test has proven to be faster, cost-effective and human error-free, the detection of somatic mutations in EGFR gene at frequencies lower than 20% is still a weak point. 
Therefore, the main project’s goal is to benefit from this technology, through the development, improvement, integration and validation of the LungCARD system with NGS workflow and development of a software for automatic reporting clinical results.

Hygienic conditions, long shelf life and easy availability of these packed products account for our standard of living. However, this convenience contributes in a significant way to environmental pollution, as packaging is mainly achieved by plastic materials in this case. Biodegradable packaging materials have been on the market for many decades. However, there are severe restrictions preventing their broad application in food packaging, as these materials do not provide the requested properties, such as a sufficient barrier against water vapour, oxygen or flavours. 
Our idea is to improve these properties by a biodegradable coating. We have developed high-barrier coatings based on a class of materials with glass-like structural units, so called ORMOCER®s. However, these coatings are not biobased, nor biodegradable.
The target of the planned project is the development of new functional hybrid (inorganic-organic) coatings for applications in food, cosmetic & medical device packaging. These new coatings will be based on the work of Fraunhofer ISC who has patented and licensed ORMOCER® lacquers used for coating applications in order to increase barrier properties of packaging films. 
The aim of the planned project is to synthesise new coating materials based on bioORMOCER®s, which are formed of functionalised biopolymers extracted from lignocellulosic biomass sources using the bioORMOCER® synthesis approach. In particular, the polymeric structures of hemicelluloses and polyesters will be exploited. By the use of these biopolymer, the organoalkoxysilanes which are components of the state-of-the art ORMOCER® lacquers will be substituted to obtain a purely biobased functional coating material.

New integrated technologies for more efficient supermarkets are now available and efficiency improvements up to 30% have already been demonstrated. These heating and cooling technologies offer in the mid-term both environmental and economic benefits. The uptake of such efficient solutions is mainly hindered by non-technological market barriers.
SuperSmart tackles different barrier categories, both short-term (awareness and knowledge) and long-term (organizational, political, social), even though an immediate impact on the sector will be expected to come already from the removal of the short-term hindrances. The purpose of the SuperSmart hub is to establish a knowledge transfer and promotion platform devoted to the supermarket sector to educate/train and crosslink stakeholders of various backgrounds in such a way that the uptake of energy-efficient heating and cooling solutions is made possible. Specific objectives pursued by the hub for the supermarket sector contain:
- Reduce the environmental impact and primary energy demand 
- Support the introduction of a new EU Ecolabel for Supermarkets 
- Determine and remove challenges hindering the implementation of  eco-energy supermarkets 
- Raise the expertise level of the different decision makers (non –technical and tech. staff) related to energy usage of   equipment and the benefit of integrated systems.  Encourage to supply energy (heating&cooling) to nearby business units or local grids.

The basic TransUP concept is to tackle the challenge of making the Alpe Adria region an attractive hub for innovative entrepreneurs and investors, where the ecosystem made of actors and services devoted to support the creation and development of new businesses is really collaborative and transnational.
Technology startups in the peripheral European territories like the Alpine Adriatic usually  look to Western Europe or to the USA rather than to neighboring countries for models of change and development. 
The overall objective of the TransUP project is thus to collaboratively address a common innovation support challenge and to peer-review transnational support services and co-design an innovative and systemic Crossregional Softlanding Programme for enhancing a multicultural and international driven attitude among startups in order to improve their survival chances on the global market. 
The Crossregional Softlanding Programme is aimed at offering to startups from neighboring regions Carinthia (Austria), Friuli Venezia Giulia (Italy), Slovenia and the newly entered EU member state Croatia, the possibility to develop their company within a multicultural environment. The expected result is the activation of a comprehensive international attitude in all aspects of startup business management with positive effects from market reach to competitive strength.

Young people face tough choices in key areas of social life that affect their participation in society, and their potential marginalisation from it: from structural issues of unemployment, lack of access to affordable housing and debt problems, to information overload on big questions like the environment, identity, faith and radicalisation, and negotiating the moral challenges of illegal markets and an increasingly sexualised social-media generation. While there are wide variations in opportunities and challenges between and within countries, young people today face tough choices in negotiating this moral maze. The PROMISE project will investigate how young people’s, often negative, responses to these problems create conflict, and how, instead, their responses can provide opportunities for positive social engagement. By addressing the experiences, values and attitudes of European youth seen to be in conflict with older generations, authorities and social norms PROMISE will get to the heart of barriers and opportunities for social engagement. We will employ a four pronged methodology to gather and analyse data (primary and secondary) on a cross-national level, alongside comparative ethnographic case study data that uniquely addresses the experiences of ‘conflicted’ youth within the context and social history of each country. Each case study will address a site of conflict and stigmatisation as a (potential) site of innovation or social change. Throughout the process, we will involve young people across Europe in setting the agenda, in documenting their situation and in articulating their needs. PROMISE will produce a comparative ethnography of young people in 10 European countries, a comparative quantitative analysis of attitudes, values and control, and policy papers and positive engagement strategies.

Glycoconjugate vaccines represent the key for success of vaccination in children. The covalent linkage to proteins renders carbohydrates able to evoke a T-cell memory response. Current vaccines are prepared from heterogeneous mixtures of sugars linked by unspecific methods to the carrier protein giving complex mixtures of products. Due to this intricate structure, it has not been possible to apply a medicinal chemistry approach in the development of glycoconjugate vaccines and to fully understand their mechanism of action. Combination of novel approaches for glycan synthesis and site-selective conjugation methods now gives access to conjugates defined in sugar component and attachment site, thus leading to robust structure-immunogenicity relationship. Advancements in structural biophysics can be applied to select the optimal glycan antigen. By combining the beneficiaries’ expertise in carbohydrate synthesis, bioconjugation, high throughput screening, structural glycobiology, vaccinology and immunology, together with the experience in project management, GLYCOVAX will create a multidisciplinary environment  where 14 young researchers will contribute to develop a novel route towards improved, safer and better characterized glycoconjugate vaccines, and contemporarily acquire transferable skills which will lead them to become the new leaders of academic or industrial research.

Early detection is crucial as treatment is most efficient in early stages where population based screenings could substantially reduce incidence and mortality.
Current screening techniques are invasive or lack sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms leading to the formation of different antigens suggested as CRC biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets are poorly understood, especially with regard to carbohydrate-based molecules, such as glycans. Enhancing our understanding of the structure-function relationship of glycosylation in CRC could lead to the discovery of improved diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and pave the way for nov-el therapeutic targets.
Building on an established network of analysts with many years of experience in (glyco)proteomics and biomarker research, in collaboration with colleagues in the field of glycobiology and glyco-immunology, GlyCoCan will develop new methods, and use current state of the art methods, to investigate the role of glycosylation in many different aspects of CRC.

The underlying specific research objectives will be addressed within individual ESR projects, giving rise to a generation of ESRs whose main focus is investigating and tackling the challenges of the role of glycosylation within CRC and other diseases. 
The network will address the currently unmet need for glycosylation researchers with an inter-disciplinary perspective to fully exploit the immense potential of the young scientific field of glyco-oncology and to set them on a path to successful and productive careers in academic and industrial collaborations.",3297697.3,3293890.61,H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015,MSCA-ITN-ETN,ACADEMISCH ZIEKENHUIS LEIDEN,NL,LUDGER LIMITED;FACULDADE DE CIENCIAS MEDICAS DA UNIVERSIDADE NOVA DE LISBOA;STICHTING VU;GENOS DOO ZA VJESTACENJE I ANALIZU;STICHTING VUMC;ALMA MATER STUDIORUM - UNIVERSITA DI BOLOGNA;MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV;CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS;NOVA ID FCT - ASSOCIACAO PARA A INOVACAO E DESENVOLVIMENTO DA FCT,UK;PT;NL;HR;IT;DE;FR,NA

It does so by exchanging accelerator scientists and experts between Europe and Japan.
The recent European Strategy for Particle Physics and the Japanese Roadmap identify similar pressing goals of research for the next decades. The strategy emphasises the exploitation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its upgrades, preparation of the cases for new facilities at the energy frontier (FCC or CLIC), identifies the opportunities for electron positron collisions (ILC), particularly after the recent discovery of the Higgs boson, and recognises the need for a long baseline neutrino programme at J-PARC in addition to the BELLE II programme of KEK.
The user community at these facilities is international: a strong contingent of Japanese researchers from KEK and universities work on the ATLAS experiment, highly qualified experts from KEK contribute to the LHC itself, some two thousand researchers worldwide have signed the ILC design report and several hundred physicists are actively engaged in accelerator studies, such as on ATF to explore concepts generally applicable to linear colliders. The J-PARC neutrino experiment, with a strong European participation, has recently published important scientific results.
The planned exchange of staff of leading European Laboratories and Universities with two prominent Japanese partners, KEK and University of Tokyo will focus on the most critical subjects and profiles namely on the design, R&D and prototyping of the future accelerator facilities mentioned above.

E.g. Stockholm grew by more than 12.000 people / a (1.5%); in the next 10 years Vienna has to build for 200.000 new people. Efficient and effective planning processes will be crucial for climbing this mountain.
Vienna, Berlin, Paris, Stockholm, Amsterdam/Zaanstad, Warsaw and Zagreb aim to enhance the capacity of their local authorities on integrative urban energy planning, as response to new challenges from EU EPBD and RES directives as well as to  changes of technologies and market conditions and the pressure to provide sufficient, affordable homes. The focus is put on the governance processes related to the (re-)development of concrete sites. While some cities already started ambitious urban development projects, the institutionalisation of these experiences is missing - despite awareness and willingness, due to lack of knowledge, lack of time and the need for collaboration across departments, which is not a common practice in many administrations in Europe. External stimulus is needed to overcome these barriers, and to address these issues collectively with external key stakeholders, such as DNOs and energy suppliers, and across cities. 
Focus will be on multi-disciplinary learning  – concentrating on innovative technological solutions, instruments and tools as well as on innovative governance elements - and to capitalise this learning to institutionalise integrative urban energy planning. 
Improving the governance processes is expected to have significant energy impacts on homes and workplaces to be built and refurbished for over 3 million more people in the participating cities in the next 20 years: more than 1.700 GWh/a of energy savings and over 2.000 GWh/a renewable energy produced.

Since biological treatment (anaerobic digestion) is without an alternative for energy utilization of food waste and together with other raw materials creates a synergy for renewable energy production (biogas/biomethane). One of the biggest advantages of such a concept of energy production is having two issues covered at the same time: environmental protection with sustainable management of food waste and the production of renewable energy with its utilization as a biofuel.
The existing technologies which are specific for this kind of raw materials will be explored.

 1. Provide large-scale capacity building or engagement activities: The key objective is to engage and empower a ‘critical mass’ of over 1,000 stakeholders with the process of defining and implementing their long-term national renovation strategy (Article 4, Energy Efficiency Directive). Process carried out by an important organisational innovation, ‘Green Building Councils’ (GBCs), in BG,CZ,ES, HR, IT, IE, FI, LV, RO, SE, SI, SK and TR. GBCs are multi-stakeholder platforms, formalising a ‘Regional Action Network’ of connected actors who will ensure the continuation of the activities beyond the project’s duration.

 2. Target specific actors among a wide spectrum of stakeholders: The renovation stakeholder ecosystem will be mapped across the Project countries, to understand precisely which organisations will be needed to define and implement Article 4 and how this system functions. BUILD UPON has received over 100 letters of support across all its target groups.

 3. Demonstrate a strong European added value:  The complex landscape of renovation initiatives (both public policy and market driven) will be compressed in a living ‘RenoWiki’ resource, to enable stakeholder understanding and dialogue, and ensure all stakeholders are ‘on the same page’. The stakeholder ‘community’ will be developed through a series of nearly 80 workshops across the region at local, national and European level. These will explore collaborative and solution focused working methods to deliver the stakeholder buy-in required by government to define and implement ambitious and viable Article 4 strategies.

Sudden cardiac death accounts for 50% of cardiac mortality in developed countries; ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation is the commonest underlying arrhythmia. In the ambulatory population, atrial fibrillation is the commonest one, and is associated with increased risk of stroke and heart failure, particularly in the aged population. If arrhythmias are detected at an early stage of heart disease, appropriate treatment can be effective, reducing disability and death. However, in the early stages of disease these may be transient, lasting only a few seconds, and thus difficult to detect. Current approaches to cardiac rhythm monitoring include: a) non-invasive external recording devices; which are suitable for short term (<24h) recording, and b) implantable loop recorders, which are inserted subcutaneously beneath the chest wall; capable of monitoring heart rhythm for extended periods, but there is considerable expense associated with the device, hospitalisation costs and risk of infection.

  The proposed joint research project through staff exchange activities, will investigate enabling technologies for non-invasive recording heart rhythm during long periods of time (>36h), using a wrist or arm wearable device with novel ECG sensing techniques and embedded real-time cardiac arrhythmia detection processes. The problem of extracting the far-field heart electrogram signal from noise components will be addressed using smart denoising algorithms.

  The project will impact by establishing a successful international and intersectoral partnership for the development of new technologies addressing a significant cardiovascular healthcare problem.

ROXANNE will contribute towards this goal by bridging the strengths of speech and language technologies (SLTs), visual analysis (VA) and network analysis (NA). If funded, ROXANNE will achieve a significant increase in the speed of investigation processes and an improvement in identification of individuals by means of speech, in the scope of criminal cases where large amounts of lawfully intercepted communications (with multilingual attributes) are analysed.  
The technical development will be centred around the ROXANNE platform, which will enhance criminal network analysis capabilities by providing a framework for extracting evidence and actionable intelligence based on speech, language and video technologies. The intention is not to replace humans but automate time-consuming tasks, and support LEA decision-making. Its early version will offer preliminary SLT, VA and NA capabilities to collect end-user feedback.  The final version will provide multilingual, probabilistic tools interfacing SLT and NA technologies, boosted by natural language processing (NLP) and relation analysis in the synoptic criminal activity graph. ROXANNE will achieve full compliance with relevant INTERPOL and EU legal and ethical frameworks, including innovative approaches to data protection management such as privacy by design.  
Special efforts will be expended to ensure ROXANNE outcomes achieve widespread adoption by law enforcement.

At the same time, urban systems are particularly vulnerable to impacts of climate change and suffer from degraded or lack of natural ecosystems to help alleviate these impacts. A promising approach to deal with these challenges is to work with nature’s capacity and qualities in a sustainability perspective. Working with nature in urban settings has advantages over other approaches: multi-functionality, multi-benefits and cost-effectiveness. Nature Based Solutions (NBS) are interventions that seek to restore, improve, enhance or conserve natural capital and biodiversity in terms of habitats or ecosystems. Subsequently, these ecosystems provide enhanced multiple ecosystem services that contribute to social and economic benefits, reducing the urban societal challenges. They can help build climate resilience in cities, improve liveability, and in collaboration with other urban priorities contribute to building inclusive communities, closing social equality gaps, while promoting innovative businesses and jobs.  The aim of Regreen is to generate evidence for how Nature-based solutions (NBS) underpinned by improved urban governance, and public and private participation can systematically integrate ecosystem services and biodiversity and advocate their benefits and values in urban planning to meet societal challenges including climate change resilience, public health and well-being, and social inclusion.

However, the ecosystem services (ESS) provided by these agro-ecosystems – including food, bioenergy, water, carbon storage and biodiversity – are threatened by processes such as land-use intensification and changing climate. European, national and regional policy makers must hence rethink and redesign rural policy to enhance the sustainability of agricultural landscapes while ensuring farmers’ livelihoods at the same time. However, the policy impact assessment models currently used by the European Commission (EC) ignore the complexity of farmers’ decision making, potentially leading to incorrect predictions of policy outcomes. Furthermore, existing models focus on narrow aspects of agricultural economics (e.g. income), ignoring policy impacts on rural natural, social and cultural assets. BESTMAP will develop a new modelling framework using insights from behavioural theory, linking existing economic modelling with individual-farm Agent-Based Models. Using these new modular and customizable tools BESTMAP will quantitatively model, map and monitor co-designed policy scenarios’ impacts on the environment, climate system, delivery of ESS, as well as socio-economic metrics (e.g. jobs).

The image or idea of a “promised land”, however, might not be real, and newcomers are often faced with obstacles and challenges. Certain narratives and perceptions of Europe influence migration aspirations and false images can not only lead to problems when the image does not hold true, but it might also even lead to security threats, risks or radicalisation. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to understand and investigate narratives about Europe, how these can lead to problems and threats, how they are distributed, and, in a next step, find ways to react and counteract on them. Perceptions on Europe are formed in the country of residence, and they are based on a multitude of sources. Social media and new communication networks, in addition, have increased the scope and the intensity of distribution of such narratives; and furthermore, so-called filter bubbles and echo chambers can lead to isolated misperceptions that are not corrected. Due to new communication technologies, false or incorrect claims become life on their own, raise expectations or disapproval. At the same time, however, these technologies and communication networks might also provide a channel to set an exaggerated image straight and to promote a more realistic narrative.

Traditional approaches to traffic safety shall be complemented by a cultural perspective which has emerged recently in safety research and prevention. Safety culture has been identified as an important factor of road safety as it helps understanding and explaining the typical patterns of risk perception and risk taking that prevail in different national, regional or local traffic systems as well as their relationships with numbers and forms of accidents. A weak safety culture produce higher numbers of accidents which are more severe. A strong safety culture helps reducing the number of accidents as well as mitigating their severity. It strengthens safety relevant attitudes and behaviour and it is also a condition for making road safety measures more effective.
According to a working definition of the US Department of Transportation Safety Council (US DOT), traffic safety culture is defined as the shared values, actions, and behaviours that demonstrate a commitment to safety over competing goals and demands. However, a unified concept of safety culture still does not exist. Therefore, the project will elaborate an empirically grounded and theoretically adequate concept of traffic safety culture, based on this definition by conducting a number of case studies of different traffic safety cultures across Europe. It focuses on the safety cultures that emerge under different institutional, demographic and topographical conditions and their influence on the numbers and forms of accidents. 

Research focuses on the culturally mediated interaction between traffic participants and their environment in terms of the cultural patterns of risk taking and risk perception.

The goal of this project is  to support and promote the  (partial) substitution of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) used for heating, by available bioenergy sources (industrial wastes, forest biomass, straw and other agricultural biomass) in the partner countries and beyond. In this context, the project will contribute to increase much-needed security of energy supply through lower dependence on fossil fuels from politically volatile sources. Target groups are, on the one hand, owners and operators of industrial heating plants (for private or district heating). On the other hand, actors who play an important role with regard to the value chain and to framework conditions crucial for the use of bioenergy heat will also be involved. 
Activities will be tailored to the needs of actors relevant to promising market segments in the industrial, commercial, services and agriculture sectors. Results of the project will include information about market potentials, capacity building/training, decision-support tools and communication activities targeted at relevant stakeholder, tools to support the careful assessment, planning and implementation of such projects, and dissemination of “best-practice” business models.

Annual impact assessment reports show that we significantly influenced the perception and knowledge of the general public regarding WHAT the researchers do, but they also showed that there is room for improving the ways of showing WHO the researchers are, by making the personalities and faces of the researchers recognizable to the society, as well as in clarifying WHY they become researchers, i.e. their motivation and inspiration to explain why research matters to society. Therefore, without losing a focus on WHAT, RN 2014-2015 will focus on the questions of WHO and WHY in order to offer a new dimension of perceiving the researchers and offer more answers beyond the WHAT question. 
Friend2U - Researchers’ Night project aims at bringing the researchers closer to the general public and increasing awareness of the research and innovation activities with a view to supporting the public recognition of researchers, creating understanding of the impact of the researchers' work on our daily life, and encouraging young people to embark on scientific careers. In other words, it aims at increasing mutual understanding, interest and connections, and facilitating a dialogue between the researchers and the general public. In a nutshell, it is about making the researchers friends with the common people i.e. the general public - as closest friends as possible.  Friend2U project proposal mixes, blends and unites faces, voices, results and energies of many generations of the researchers in offering the public at large, regardless of their age, education and scientific background, the opportunity to make friends with these researchers.

UNCAP delivers an interoperable platform based on open industrial standards that leverages on existing technologies for biosensing, indoor/outdoor localisation and home-automation. The result is an open source, scalable and privacy-savvy ecosystem compatible with existing Personal Health Record systems, that can deliver novel services that can help aging people (incl. those with cognitive impairments) live independently and with dignity. 
To do so, UNCAP uses state-of-art physical/cognitive assessment tools together with technologies to locate objects, devices and users within indoor/outdoor spaces, to continuously monitor–in a non-invasive way- users and to assist them in case alert conditions are detected. 
In practice, UNCAP develops a product suite for formal and informal care environments made of: 1) the UNCAP BOX (an Android consumer device connected to TVs); 2) the UNCAP App for both users and caregivers; 3) the UNCAP CLOUD, delivering scalable care services; 4) the UNCAP certification suite, to help software and hardware manufacturers assess compliancy with standards.
UNCAP will be assessed for 12 months in 14 pilots within real operational scenarios. 
Pilots will be located in rehabilitation centres, daily nursing facilities etc. and will involve 750\ users and 220 caregivers. Users’ physical & cognitive assessment will be carried on before and after the introduction of UNCAP to extract quantifiable metrics to assess its impact in terms of quality of care services and improved quality of life of users and caregivers.

The focus of the project is on building construction and process industries (from architects to raw material suppliers). 
The BAMB-project implements the principles of the waste hierarchy: the prevention of waste, its reuse and recycling. Key is to improve the value of materials used in buildings for recovery. This is achieved by developing and integrating two complementary value adding frameworks, (1) materials passports and (2) reversible building design. These frameworks will be able to change conventional (cradle-to-grave) building design, so that buildings can be transformed to new functions (extending their life span) or disassembled to building components or material feedstock that can be upcycled in new constructions (using materials passports). This way, continuous loops of materials are created while large amounts of waste will be prevented. 
Activities from research to market introduction are planned. Fundamental knowledge gaps should be bridged in order to introduce both frameworks on the market. Advanced ICT tools and management models will enable market uptake and the organization of circular value chains in building and process industries. New business models for (circular) value chains will be developed and tested on selected materials. The inclusion of strategic partners along the value chains in an industrial board will maximize market replicability potential, while several (mostly privately funded) building pilots will demonstrate the potential of the new techniques.

Waste in research represents tens of billions of Euros spent each year on studies that are redundant, flawed in their design, never published or poorly reported. The public is the main victim of this waste and reducing waste and increasing value of research represents a major societal challenge. Our proposal involving 15 early-stage researchers, aims to 1) prepare students for envisioning the future challenges in clinical research and find innovative solutions to face them, 2) train students to go well beyond the state-of-the-art in their research, 3) help students think differently, taking advantage of the multidisciplinary expertise and intercultural diversity of the network, 4) teach students how to move from research to action and convert knowledge and idea into a product, and 5) help students develop skills to match the public and private sector needs and create new professional opportunities. 

MIROR will bring together 7 world-class research teams in various disciplines (computer sciences, applied mathematics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical epidemiology, psychology, social sciences and translational medicine) from 6 different European countries; 6 non-academic partners involved in diverse sectors, and 4 major academic partners.

Anthropogenic pressures, however, cause serious threat to ecosystems, leading to habitat degradation, increased risk of collapse and loss of ecosystem services. Knowledge-based conservation, management and restoration policies are needed to improve ecosystem benefits in face of increasing pressures. ECOPOTENTIAL makes significant progress beyond the state-of-the-art and creates a unified framework for ecosystem studies and management of protected areas (PA). ECOPOTENTIAL focuses on internationally recognized PAs in Europe and beyond in a wide range of biogeographic regions, and it includes UNESCO, Natura2000 and LTER sites and Large Marine Ecosystems. Best use of Earth Observation (EO) and monitoring data is enabled by new EO open-access ecosystem data services (ECOPERNICUS). Modelling approaches including information from EO data are devised, ecosystem services in current and future conditions are assessed and the requirements of future protected areas are defined. Conceptual approaches based on Essential Variables, Macrosystem Ecology and cross-scale interactions allow for a deeper understanding of the Earth's Critical Zone. Open and interoperable access to data and knowledge is assured by a GEO Ecosystem Virtual Laboratory Platform, fully integrated in GEOSS. Support to transparent and knowledge-based conservation and management policies, able to include information from EO data, is developed. Knowledge gained in the PAs is upscaled to pan-European conditions and used for planning and management of future PAs.

The VITAL project aims to address this challenge by assessing the ID burden and mechanisms of immunosenescence to provide evidence-based knowledge on vaccination strategies to establish healthy ageing. Links with existing projects containing data sources combined with novel data acquired through our extensive network of dataregistries across Europe will result in a database of epidemiology, risk factors and burden of disease of both vaccine-preventable (VP) and potential vaccine-preventable ID. Crucial knowledge on factors that hamper immune responsiveness and in-depth analyses of immune compartments involved in inducing effective immune responses to different vaccines in the ageing host will be gathered. We will identify novel predictive, potentially universal immune profiles of vaccine responses using novel technologies, unique experimental models and (infection) cohorts of elderly subjects in which (bio)markers of frailty have already been identified. Novel strategies to address the problem of immunosenescence will be tested, in particular whether vaccination of middle-aged individuals can maintain proper memory immune responses in the elderly, to improve memory immunity before reaching old age. Using data on epidemiology of VPID and immune responsiveness, novel agent-based models will be developed to build a user-friendly tool to be used by health care professionals for optimal implementation of vaccination strategies for older people and to develop dissemination protocols for the obtained knowledge for the health care field. Finally, we will deliver a framework that forms the basis for designing, implementing and regularly updating vaccination schemes for the ageing population.

Specific objectives are to develop:
•Local CCUS development plans, with local business models, within promising start‐up regions;
•Connection plans with transport corridors between local CCUS clusters, and with the North Sea infrastructure, in order to improve performance and reduce costs, thus contributing to build a Europe-wide CCUS infrastructure.
As recommended by the SET Plan Action 9, the STRATEGY CCUS project will study options for CCUS clusters in Eastern and Southern Europe, as at present the CCUS clusters being progressed are concentrated in Western Europe around the North Sea. Therefore, the project is timely for the strategic planning for CCUS development in the whole of Europe.
Strategic planning will consider 8 promising regions, within 7 countries (ES, FR, GR, HR, PO, PT, RO) representing 45% of the European CO2 emissions from the industry and energy sectors. These regions satisfy CCUS relevant criteria: presence of an industrial cluster, possibilities for CO2 storage and/or utilization, potential for coupling with hydrogen production and use, existing studies, and political will. 
The methodology starts with a detailed mapping of CCUS technical potential of the regions together with a comprehensive mapping of local stakeholders and a process for their engagement. This will pave the ground for CCUS deployment scenarios including assessment of 'bankable' storage capacity, economic and environmental evaluation. 
The project strength relies on of a highly skilled consortium with experience on the whole CCUS chain as well as key transverse skills.

The increase in energy democracy and social equity will be an essential part of the clean energy transition.  A transition that could represent one of the most fundamental social, economic and technical changes in modern history.

The most common businesses associated with social innovation in the renewable energy sector are Cooperatives, Aggregators and Crowdfunding platforms.  These businesses facilitate consumers to take a more active role in the electricity system. Achieving sustained growth in energy democracy requires a better understanding of support structures for successful social innovation across technical, legal and economic systems.

Altogether, Energy Efficiency Compliant Products 3 (EEPLIANT3) is expected to substantially enhance the impacts and the overall effectiveness and efficiency of market surveillance across the European Union (EU). 

The core objective of this proposal is to continue the transformation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the market surveillance work undertaken across the European Union (EU) in the field of the Energy Labelling Regulation 2017/1369 and the Ecodesign Directive 2009/125. This will be achieved through the coordination of the monitoring, verification and enforcement activities of 24 MSAs and 5 other organisations across the Single Market plus Turkey and through further enhancing their knowledge, skills and experience of doing this type of work. Key to this effort will be the development of strategic IT tools that overlap with every WP in the project and that aim to go beyond business as usual. These tools will help MSAs achieve greater results with the same level of resources, a necessity in light of the doubling of Ecodesign and energy labelling requirements over the past six years without equivalent increases in financing.
Furthermore, the project will seek to enhance the visibility and outreach of market surveillance activities by engaging with key stakeholders ― the ADCOs, the EU trade associations of the suppliers of the products to be inspected and consumer organisations. As a result, stakeholders will continue to build confidence in the increasing effectiveness of market surveillance in the EU/EEA.

The project directly addresses all the requirements identified in the Call. The Scope calls for strengthening the enforcement of these two pieces of legislation and specifically asks for supporting the monitoring, verification and enforcement activities of MSAs.
The main activity described in this proposal is the market surveillance of specific product sectors and the (further) development of tools – including innovative IT-tools – and methodologies in support of the MSAs.

Within this context, authorities in charge of border and maritime patrol are faced with different challenges that include the heterogeneity of the traffic that undertakes illegal activities in European waters, limitations in the ability to collect and share timely available data among institutional organizations, as well as a lack of assets by the relevant authorities to cover the wide maritime areas under their mandate. Although there has been an expressive investment done in the domain of surveillance technologies and tools, the intake by the competent authorities has been slow, due to lack of uniformity in the integration of such systems with existing surveillance infrastructures. In order to address these challenges, project COMPASS2020 aims to demonstrate the combined use and seamless coordination of manned and unmanned assets to achieve greater coverage, better quality of information and shorter response times in maritime surveillance operations. The proposed solution will be based on an innovative CONOPS that makes use of multiple aerial and underwater unmanned vehicles with improved capabilities, deployed from OPVs or from land, and will be supported by a central, multi-domain and interoperable Mission System (MS) that enables the operation of these platforms from both locations. UxVs may act as deported ship sensors, providing critical mission data to the MS that can then be exploited through dedicated services to be developed in the scope of the project (e.g. Data Fusion and Threat Risk Analysis).

It will incorporate ethical aspects and societal risk perception and will manage acceptable and unacceptable risks through transfer or mitigation. The focus of RiskGONE will be to produce nano-specific draft guidance documents for application to ENM RA; or, alternatively, to suggest ameliorations to OECD, ECHA, and ISO/CEN SOPs or guidelines. Rather than producing assays and methods ex novo, this will be achieved through Round Robin exercises and multimodal testing of OECD TGs and ECHA methods supporting the “Malta-project”, and on methods not yet considered by OECD. This process will be accelerated by guidance documents for data storage/curation/accessibility optimisation, applied to well-characterized reference ENMs typifying the main physicochemical and toxicological features of ENMs. A transparent, self-sustained RG council, representing EU stakeholders, member states, industry and civil society, will be established.

The current management of such diseases only allows a momentary patient assessment at the time point of out-clinic visit or hospitalization. Short-term trends in disease development, either deterioration or improvement, are not accessible. Continuous  and real-time monitoring, especially in remote settings (e.g. patients’ homes) is not available. Additionally the devices used for monitoring the patients are massive, expensive, uncomfortable and difficult to operate, thus requiring specialized personnel. Several of them also rely on patients´ cooperation and compliance to guarantee proper examination results. The incorporation of novel electronics in garments presents great potential for addressing these challenges. More specifically, the adoption of Application-Specific-Integrated-Circuits (ASICs) neatly integrated in a comfortable and washable wearable is the key that makes the accurate and effective (in terms of both, cost and quality of life) continuous monitoring of lung diseases feasible.

As a global Consortium composed of eight European and nine non-European partners, we seek to (1) to identify, evaluate, compare and share practices in five major local government areas (local responsibilities, local finances, local government structure, intergovernmental relations and people’s participation); (2) to encourage the effective application of the best-fit practices by local governments; (3) to strengthen international and intersectoral collaborative research; (4) to enhance the career perspectives of the staff involved by increasing their mobility both within the academic and the non-academic sectors and between these sectors.
LoGov’s methodological approach relies on a comprehensive comparative analysis that draws on findings from 15 countries or wider regions on six continents, the extensive involvement of local policy-makers through local government associations and a multi- and interdisciplinary approach that is facilitated by the Consortium’s expertise in four disciplines (public law, political science, public administration and economics).
The training strategy of LoGov is based on both secondment-related and network-wide activities. The strategy combines well-established events with newly developed transferable and research skills training, including open science, communication and research transfer training.
To achieve the maximum impact, LoGov’s dissemination strategy targets both the wider scientific community and local policy-makers.

The project starts from the fact that European countries and their education systems encounter manifold challenges due to growing ethnic, cultural, linguistic diversity and thereby aims at:

1) Identifying existing measures for the integration of migrant children at the regional and local level through secondary data analysis; 
2) Analysis of the social impacts of these integration programmes through case studies in ten countries applying qualitative and quantitative child-centred research; 
3) Development of integration measures and identification of social investment particularly in educational policies and school systems that aim to empower children. 

The project is problem-driven and exploratory at the same time. Its exploratory part mainly concerns a child-centred approach to understanding integration challenges, migrants’ needs and their well-being. However, the findings of the open-ended exploratory research will be used in an explicitly problem-driven way – with an aim to stimulate migrant inclusion, to empower migrant children and build their skills already within the (participatory) research.

COMPILE project aims to activate and use Local Energy Systems in order to support the fast growth of energy production from RES in constrained networks, and foster the transition from centralized system with passive users into a flexible network of active users featuring energy communities. This transformation aims to enhance RES integration and increase the security of supply, without traditional network reinforcement. COMPILE is uniting the efforts of DSOs, market actors and the communities of active consumers, since increasing decentralization needs more consumer engagement and participation. The project aims to better understand the way emerging decentralized solutions and the existing centralized infrastructure operate together in an economically efficient way. In COMPILE, we focus on showing the benefit of cooperation through energy communities that will solve current grid problems in a coordinated way, avoiding the costly network reinforcement while leading to an increased RES share. 

The demo cases in COMPILE are positioned along the spectrum of this passive-/active consumer transition and will show different approaches to coordination of consumers, technology and business models. The demos will have different “starting point”: different countries, different technology, organizational levels, community sizes, composition (industry/houses/retail), and regulatory perspective. All COMPILE demos feature a high replicability potential.

The project encompasses research and innovation activities. It will carry out challenging research on historical peace treaties and conflict settlements, as well as on contemporary representations of religious cohabitation in culture and media. Studying historical peace-making initiatives will deepen our understanding of how religious conflicts and tensions have been accommodated and solved in different traditions (Christian, Muslim, Jewish) over time. Research into contemporary representations will subsequently reveal how such initiatives are used, misinterpreted or ignored in different types of culture and media today. These studies will provide insights into (a) effective policies and practices for approaching religious coexistence, and (b) alternative representations of religious cohabitation that engage constructively with contemporary concerns and past traditions. 
Based on this research, RETOPEA will develop innovative educational tools and evidence-based policy recommendations.

Retrofitting means often lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), shorter lead times, faster implementation, less production time losses, lower risks and therefore faster project development and increased market benefits. BIOFIT aims to facilitate bioenergy retrofitting in five industries: first-generation biofuels, pulp and paper, fossil refineries, fossil firing power and combined heat and power plants. 

First an overview will be made of existing options for retrofitting, and best practices analysed, to establish (both technical and non-technical) success factors. This will constitute the basis for two core project actions i.e. the development of 10 concrete bioenergy retrofitting proposals (2 each per industry) and the establishment of dedicated working groups for each industry (industry platform) to facilitate two-way dialogue. Both actions will be industry-driven, and focus on identifying and helping to solve actual – general and industry-specific – barriers towards wider market uptake. BIOFIT will give specific attention to generating information for policy development. Acceptance of bioenergy, both by the industries and by the general public, is key to the industries’ transformation towards sustainable bioenergy generation and market uptake. Research into acceptance factors is an integral part of project set-up. Key issues will be highlighted, and guidelines for industries will be issued. 

The BIOFIT consortium is a multidisciplinary partnership, with strong industrial involvement, broad coverage across Europe, and existing practical experience developing bioenergy retrofits. The expertise of the consortium covers all five target industries.

Over the last decade, water quality observing technology has risen to the challenge of scientists to identify and mitigate poor water quality by providing them with cost-effective tools that can take measurements of essential biogeochemical variables autonomously. Yet, despite these options becoming more readily available, there is a gap between the technology and the end-user (including the investigators and technicians that deploy these technologies) due to a collective lack of training, in-depth knowledge, and skilled workers who can meet new and emerging challenges. There is also a disconnect between data quality, data gathering by autonomous sensors and data analysis, which is a major obstacle, as the sensors are already being deployed (e.g. through buoys, boats etc.). AQUASENSE will address these challenges through 15 early stage researchers (ESRs), who will receive 540 person-month of unparalleled multidisciplinary training in the field of water quality monitoring. Each ESR will be mentored by carefully selected experts from academia and industry in 9 European countries (UK, Germany, Ireland, Serbia, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Austria, Estonia) and will have access to state-of-the-art equipment to develop autonomous sensors for improved data quality. The autonomous underwater robots and drones will be used to improve the data gathering and AI methods will be used to improve the data analysis. Hands-on project training will be supplemented with formal training courses in relevant fields such as new materials, sensors fabrication, wireless communication, system integration, and robotics, and a variety of complementary courses such as IPR, grant writing and exploiting the scientific results.

Knowledge is compiled at two levels: at the level of Actor Groups’ specific farming system and value chain activities, and in seven technical areas of agricultural sector and value-chain transition (Transition Networks). The project addresses an urgent need and cross-sector challenges by building on technical opportunities. The urgent need is due to the imbalance in cropping systems now dominated by cereal crops with adverse agronomic and environmental effects. The cross-sector challenge arises from the growing demand for alternative sources of plant protein, growing consumer interest in the environmental impact and resource efficiency of value chains, growing demand for GMO-free value chains and grain legume-based foods. The technical opportunity arises from the range of innovation groups in Europe that are now translating relevant knowledge at a local and regional level. Our consortium comprises an existing innovation community represented by 15 Actor Groups with research-based knowledge, value-chain actors’ knowledge and insights from the pre-farm side of the value chain right through to retailing, including the supporting and regulating functions such as policy development. The project uses a co-learning framework to validate the knowledge compiled within Actor Groups and between Actor Groups within the seven Transition Networks. In addition to direct interaction between partners, an extensive range of primary communications provided in an internet-based knowledge platform (The Legume Hub) will have a lasting character documenting the work.

Food is not only a source of calories, but also a complex mixture of dietary chemicals, some of which are directly related to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, allergies and some types of cancer. Foods, diet and nutritional status, including overweight and obesity, are also associated with elevated blood pressure and blood cholesterol or even resistance to the action of insulin. These conditions are not only risk factors for non-communicable diseases, but major causes of illness themselves.
However, today's diet is characterized by irregular and poorly balanced meals. Unhealthy eating habits in our daily life are not only risk factors for non-communicable diseases, but also major causes of stress and tiredness, i.e., lack of energy. Knowledge about our dietary habits based on the analysis of diverse types of information, including individual parameters, can contribute greatly towards answering key questions to respond to societal challenges regarding food and health.
Motivated by the aforementioned, the PROTEIN project aims to develop an end-to-end ecosystem that will engage people to a healthy, pleasurable, nutritional and sustainable diet by offering a daily program adapted to their needs and driven by their personal preferences, physical and physiological characteristics as well as their health status. Specifically, the main objective of PROTEIN is to create an ICT-based system for providing personalized nutrition based on the collection and analysis of large volumes of data related to users' dietary behavioural patterns, physical activity and individual parameters.

The project is deeply rooted in pevious national and European projects, in which the consortium members were actively involved. The underlying principle is that Nutrient Use Efficency can be significantly improved by integrating on-farm techniques and systems that allow better reconnection between 1) animal husbandry provided flows and 2) plant production requirements. At the same time this reconnection itself will serve a better C-return to soil and GHG-reduction by avoided emissions optionally combined with energy production for self-consumption on-farm.

NUTRI2CYCLE aims to (i) benchmark mass flows of nutrients, organic carbon and GHG-footprint, (ii) provide an assessment frame (toolbox) for evaluating potential impact of proposed innovations, (iii) actively support concepts, techniques and scenarios put forward in EIP-Operational Groups, (iv) optimize these (\ in-consortium developed) scenarios using the toolbox, (v) showcase the most promising developments via prototypes and demos. Finally, using the experience gained at a local/regional scale, NUTRI2CYCLE will elaborate strategic scenarios to identify the effect of these innovations at European scale. 

NUTRI2CYCLE brings together the extensive expertise of leading experts in the field of nutrient cycling. This collaboration originates from the EIP-Focus Group on Nutrient Recycling, closely interacting with the EIP Operational Groups in the individual EU member states.

Nevertheless, the early engagement of actors is facing many challenges, and PE rarely goes beyond the stage of consultation. On the other hand, the integration of co-creation in European STI policy and programmes faces barriers such as: scarce understanding of co-creation among researchers and policy makers; “sectorialised” approach to STI policy making; lack of effective knowledge to cope with constraints that hamper the co-creation process.
The introduction of design methodologies and tools is emerging as a valuable approach to deal with these problems, as design has been already recognised as key to operationalise co-creation in different fields. Thanks to an iterative process centred on prototyping - co-design effectively support co-creation to move from the ideation of new solutions and policies to their implementation.
Given this framework, SISCODE aims: to understand co-creation as a bottom-up and design-driven phenomenon that is flourishing in Europe (in fab labs, living labs, social innovations, smart cities, communities and regions); to analyse favourable conditions that support its effective introduction, scalability and replication; and to use this knowledge to cross-fertilise RRI practices and policies. To reach this aim SISCODE will: run a European study to compare co-creation ecosystems and describe effective dynamics and outcomes of the integration of society in science and innovation; experiment with design as a new system of competences capable to support the development of implementable RRI and STI solutions and policies; and understand the transformations needed to embed co-creation in STI policy making, overcoming barriers and resistance to change and considering organisational transformation.",3999268.75,3999268.75,H2020-SwafS-2017-1,RIA,POLITECNICO DI MILANO,IT,"MAKEA INDUSTRIES GMBH;KRAKOWSKI PARK TECHNOLOGICZNY SP ZOO;ASSOCIATION TRACES THEORIES ET REFLEXIONS SUR L APPRENDRE LA COMMUNICATION ET L EDUCATION SCIENTIFIQUES;EUROPEAN NETWORK OF LIVING LABS IVZW;THE PROVOST, FELLOWS, FOUNDATION SCHOLARS & THE OTHER MEMBERS OF BOARD OF THE COLLEGE OF THE HOLY & UNDIVIDED TRINITY OF QUEEN ELIZABETH NEAR DUBLIN;AGENZIA PER LA PROMOZIONE DELLA RICERCA EUROPEA;SOCIEDADE PORTUGUESA DE INOVACAO CONSULTADORIA EMPRESARIAL E FOMENTO DA INOVACAO SA;ARISTOTELIO PANEPISTIMIO THESSALONIKIS;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITAT DORTMUND;DANSK DESIGN CENTER APS;STICHTING MUSEUM VOOR INDUSTRIE EN SAMENLEVING;CIENCIA VIVA-AGENCIA NACIONAL PARA A CULTURA CIENTIFICA E TECNOLOGICA;BIOSENSE INSTITUTE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN BIOSYSTEMS;ASSOCIATION EUROPEENNE DES EXPOSITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES TECHNIQUES ET INDUSTRIELLES;MAKER;INSTITUT D'ARQUITECTURA AVANCADA DE CATALUNYA;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON;DANSK DESIGN CENTER",DE;PL;FR;BE;IE;IT;PT;EL;DK;NL;RS;ES;UK,NA

The project seeks to apply the pillars of integrated water management (IWM) as a model for “water planning” (akin to spatial planning) and to demonstrate low cost, modular technologies that can be easily retrofitted into any water management infrastructure at district/plant level, hence enabling even small communities and SMEs to implement virtuous practices. Technologies and planning instruments complement each other as the first make possible the second and the latter can provide as example or even prescribe the former (and similar technologies allowing virtuous water use practices). Indeed the technologies support the regulators in implementing policy instruments, as foreseen by IWM, for convincing stakeholders (like developers and industry) to implement water efficiency strategies and could include instruments for e.g. rewarding virtuous behaviours (for example: advantageous water tariffs), planning regulations that award planning consent more swiftly or even prescribe the use of water from alternative sources (including recycling). Project Ô has in summary the overall objective of providing stakeholders (everybody using or regulating the use of water in an area) with a toolkit that enables them to plan the use of and utilise the resource water whatever its history and provenance, obtaining significant energy savings in terms of avoided treatment of water and waste water and release of pressure (quantity abstracted and pollution released) over green water sources.

This will be achieved by the formation of the global RRING community network and by the development and mobilisation of a global Open Access RRI knowledge base. RRING will align RRI to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a global common denominator.
The RRING project acknowledges that each region of the world is advancing its own agenda on RRI. Therefore, RRING will not be producing a Global RRI framework or strategy that is meant to be enforced in a top-down manner. Rather, increased coherence and convergence will be achieved via a bottom-up approach, learning from best practices in RRI globally and from linkages, via the new RRING community, to develop the RRI linked-up world.
Six Objectives of RRING 
Objective 1: Promote a linked up global world of RRI by creating the global RRING community network, thereby enabling mutual learning, collaboration, mobilisation of RRI concepts.
Objective 2: Mobilise, promote and disseminate a global open access knowledge base of RRI based on the State of the Art (SoA) and comparative analysis across the key geographies, all stakeholders and sectors. It will cover key platforms, spaces and players, role and influence of stakeholders, drivers and policies for R&I, regulation in public,private sectors and nation states and international organizations.
Objective 3: Align RRI to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to provide a global common denominator for advancement of RRI, and address Grand Challenges globally.
Objective 4: Determine the competitive advantages of RRI and also understand how and where RRI is perceived as a barrier and/ or disadvantage.

Going beyond the current state-of-the-art with Green Infrastructure as a one-off state intervention, the proGIreg Living Labs will develop NBS which are citizen owned and co-developed by state, market and civil society stakeholders. Innovation will take place on the technical level through the NBS deployments, on the social level through co-designing, co-creating and co-implementing NBS with local communities and on the economic level through combining NBS with market-ready business models. Four follower cities in Eastern and Southern Europe (Cascais PT, Cluj-Napoca RO, Piraeus GR, Zenica BA) will be co-steering the research process to assure replicability and adaptability to their local context resulting in urban plans for NBS deployment. The NBS to be tested i.a. include: regenerating industrial soils biotic compounds, creating community-based urban agriculture and aquaponics and making renatured river corridors accessible for local residents.
Scientific assessment and monitoring results from the Living Labs will be made available on the EU NBS platforms OPPLA and THINKNATURE and will contribute to the European reference framework for NBS. Global impact will be achieved by a training programme for cooperative planning, implementation and management of NBS. It will be provided by partners from the cities, SMEs and universities involved.

These include: the current radicalisation of young people in Europe; processes questioning the meaningfulness of the European project; and the revival of tribal identities and separatism. These processes give cause to fundamentally rethink the idea of Europeanness as a culture of dialogue and mutual respect. CHIEF aims to build an effective dialogue between different stakeholders in order to facilitate a future of Europe based on more inclusive notions of cultural heritage and identity. The project is innovative in its approach to cultural literacy of young Europeans by privileging the importance of production and transition of cultural knowledge in both formal educational settings initiated from above, and a variety of informal human interactions. These informal interactions are often overlooked despite their strong influence on how knowledge about European culture is acquired by young people. The project proposes to explore them by building an inter-disciplinary, multi-sectoral and transnational partnership in nine countries in and outside the EU. Through its research activities and social interventions, CHIEF will have a substantial impact on policies and practices facilitating intercultural dialogue in Europe. It will contribute to understanding and enhancing cultural literacy for young people, resulting in greater appreciation of diversity. The project will lead to more effective use of European cultural heritage as a site of production, translation and exchange of heterogeneous cultural knowledge.

Unsafe drinking water can contain pathogenic microorganisms and/or chemicals that can make people immediately unwell or can potentially cause serious illness over prolonged exposures. Within the EU, water is extracted from surface and groundwater sources and treated to comply with EU drinking water standards under the Water Framework Directive and Drinking Water Directive. The water is then circulated through the drinking water distribution system (DWDS). During travel within the DWDS, water quality can deteriorate due to microbiological growth, chemical reactions, interactions with ageing and deteriorating infrastructure, and through maintenance and repair activities.  

Water utilities within the EU are administered at the local level, i.e. city or county region and while they adhere to the overarching EU directives governing quality, they can choose their own treatment protocols, maintenance procedures and hydraulic operations. Some DWDS actions such as flushing may serve to improve water quality, however, these can also adversely impact the drinking water system and cause instances of poor water quality or disease outbreaks. 

We propose to bridge the gap between science and practice, involving water utilities and researchers from multiple locations across Europe along with third-country expertise, to examine DWDS operational practices and use scientific research approaches to better understand the water quality impact of different interventions to develop a suite of best practices which can be shared to ensure that the EU’s water remains clean and safe.

Based on a whole-building performance approach, the toolkit is conceived to achieve extremely high levels of energy efficiency in the existing residential building stock, with particular reference to Central and Southern Europe, where climate change and energy transition have boosted electricity consumption peaks both during summer and winter seasons. However, it may be extended equally well to new residential and commercial buildings.
The system’s central core consists of a cloud-based computing platform which concentrates managing and operational logic to support decision-making in planning and construction as well as energy performance enhancement and monitoring during operation. The Toolkit provide energy saving, energy fluxes optimization, data exchange, stakeholders’ active involvement and Smart Grid interactivity.
Interoperable building technologies and installations are also integrated in the toolkit: envelope solutions (thermal insulation and windows) ensure a reduction of thermal loads, while technical systems (BEMS, BIPV, heat pump, fan-coils, power controller, storage systems) ensure energy efficiency and RES exploitation.
All technical systems and building components are structured as a function of their affordability, interactivity, practicality, reduced installation time and non-invasiveness.
HEART's contribution to the improvement of the building renovation process can be briefly summarized through its main features:
• Retrofit planning and implementation optimization;
• Reduction of total energy consumption;
• Reinforcement of RES exploitation; 
• Rationalization of energy flows inside the building and between building and Smart Grids;
• Active involvement of stakeholders;
• Support to energy financing.",6638687.5,5669012.5,H2020-EEB-2017,IA,POLITECNICO DI MILANO,IT,AZIENDA CASA EMILIA ROMAGNA DELLA PROVINCIA DI REGGIO EMILIA;COMITE EUROPEEN DE COORDINATION DE L'HABITAT SOCIAL AISBL;TURBO POWER SYSTEMS LTD;FUNDACION CTIC CENTRO TECNOLOGICO PARA EL DESARROLLO EN ASTURIAS DE LAS TECNOLOGIAS DE LA INFORMACION;ECOLE NATIONALE DES TRAVAUX PUBLICS DE L'ETAT;VYZVOICE SA;ACCADEMIA EUROPEA DI BOLZANO;CONSTRUCCIONES GARCIA RAMA SL;ZH SRL;STILLE EKO DRUSTVO S OGRANICENOM ODGOVORNOSCU ZA TRGOVINU I USLUGE;QUANTIS;HELIOTHERM WARMEPUMPENTECHNIK GES MBH;UNIVERZA V LJUBLJANI;EST METROPOLE HABITAT;REVOLVE WATER,IT;BE;UK;ES;FR;LU;HR;CH;AT;SI,NA

The main idea of GO0D MAN project is to integrate and combine process and quality control for a multi –stage manufacturing production into a distributed system architecture built on agent-based Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and smart inspection tools designed to support Zero-Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) strategies. Data analytics tools provide a mean for knowledge build-up, system control and ZDM management. Real time and early identification of deviations and trends, performed at local level, allow to prevent the generation of defects at single stage and their propagation to down-stream processes, enabling the global system to be predictive (early detection of process faults) and proactive (self-adaptation to different conditions).
The GO0D MAN project is based on the results of previous successful EU projects and integrates them to realize and deploy a Zero Defect Manufacturing framework for multi-stage production lines, in collaboration with industry partners, a system integrator, two technology providers and three end users. The use cases are representative of key European industrial sectors and have different types of multi-stage production systems: the first use case concerns highly automated serial mass production of automotive components, the second use case is about batch production of high precision mechanical components for automotive electro valves, the third use case produces professional customized products such as ovens for restaurants.

Inaccuracies are difficult to spot and information given to stakeholders about the trajectory is limited, arriving late, and full of inconsistencies and wrong assumptions. Military Flights are currently not integrated in the ATM-system, so demanding special treatment.

Additionally, there is a lack of complete, updated, unique and coherent aeronautical and meteorological information at European level, which again limits the accuracy of the predicted trajectory and so difficult detecting incoming issues and designing optimum solutions.

This project addresses solutions for the above limitations. Harmonized and global trajectory information sharing, including improved negotiation mechanisms, will enable significant operational benefits on flight management. The aim is to enable a unique and integrated view of all flights trajectories (including military ones) among the stakeholders. This is improved thanks to new tools and capabilities ensuring all stakeholders are managing a single, updated and complete view of the forecasted meteorology and airspace configuration.

Both solutions above will increase safety and efficiency - a very important step towards ensuring that anyone can fly safer, cheaper and quicker in Europe in 10 years.

As so many stakeholders are involved, this issue cannot be solved at national level. All stakeholders (mainly air navigation service providers, as well as air and ground industry partners) need to be involved as all will need to perform changes to ensure successful implementation. The SESAR 2020 Programme is the only place where this can happen.

Observations show that today, however, there is a nearly total absence of antimatter in the Universe. The occurrence of Charge-Parity Violation (CPV) is a necessary condition for an explanation of this absence. CPV has already been observed in the quark sector but the measured amount is insufficient to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. Recent neutrino oscillation measurements indicate that the discovery of neutrino CPV becomes an important candidate to explain the observed matter dominance in the Universe. The goal of ESSnuSB project is to discover and measure neutrino CPV with unprecedented sensitivity. The ESSnuSB concept takes advantage of two outstanding opportunities. The first is the construction in Europe of the European Spallation Source, ESS, the world’s most intense proton source, with a beam power almost one order of magnitude higher than any other accelerator. The second is the recently measured unexpectedly large value of the oscillation mixing angle θ13. The latter fact implies that to obtain maximum sensitivity, the neutrino detector shall be placed at the second neutrino oscillation maximum, not at the first as implemented by the other proposed experiments. The Garpenberg mine in Sweden, in which it is proposed to install the underground neutrino detector, is situated at a distance from ESS that corresponds to the second maximum. The COST Action CA15139, “Combining forces for a novel European facility for neutrino-antineutrino symmetry-violation discovery”, already recognizes the necessity to have neutrino facilities in Europe.

society/culture of robots in a high-impact application area: Venice, Italy. Our heterogeneous system consists
of 3 different agent types: On the sea-ground, artificial mussels are the collective long-term memory of the
system, allowing information to stay beyond the runtime of other agents, thus allowing to continue learning from
previously learned states. These mussels monitor the natural habitat, including biological agents like algae, bacterial
incrustation and fish. On the water surface, artificial lilypads interface with the human society, delivering energy
and information influx from ship traffic or satellite data. Between those two layers, artificial fish
move/monitor/explore the environment and exchange info with the mussels and lilypads. Artificial mussels are a
novel class of underwater agents. We aim to push forward the edge of knowledge with novel sensors (electric
sense/electro-communication), novel bio-inspired algorithms (underwater hives) and novel energy harvesting in
underwater scenarios. We will improve the world’s record for swarm-size in autonomous collective underwater
robotics by almost one order of magnitude. Our application field is a human- and animal-co-inhabited real-world
environment of high impact: Venice canals & lagoon. These habitats are highly dynamic and structured, expected
to be reflected by a spatial self-structuring of our mussel population. These sub-populations locally perform memetic/
cultural learning algorithms on their specific local data. Thus our cultural evolution algorithms will promote
sub-culture development, similar to the human society that does the same above the water level in parallel. Overall,

It is allocated to the Industrial Research & Validation phase, developed under the SJU Private Public Partnership and will contribute to the key feature High Performing Airport Operations. The future European ATM system relies on full integration of airports as nodes into the network. In this context, PJ.03a is intended to identify and validate operational and technological solutions aiming at enhancing airport operations. 
One of the main objectives is to improve the predictability of ground operations in all weather conditions. The implementation of collaborative decision making process involving all relevant stakeholders will ensure an optimization of airport resources allocation. This feature will rely on enhanced integration between aircraft and ground systems which is expected to be achieved through the full implementation of the SWIM concept. 
It is also important to increase the efficiency and safety of airport operations by improving the current infrastructures and CNS systems. The availability of more accurate navigation information through the use of GNSS (augmented) systems, an automated switching of taxiway lights and (virtual) stop bars according to the AGL service, data link information exchange between controllers and pilots/vehicle and the on-board availability of advanced vision systems will result in an increased situational awareness with an impact on safety. 
PJ.03a will also focus on the integration of RPAS surface operations into airport operations to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, their compliance with the existing rules and regulations defined for an environment dominated by manned aviation.

Reaching the goals for the European Airspace is only possible with focused and extensive technical developments on European level. One of the major challenges is making sure every actor in ATM has the right information at the right time and in a consistent manner, as ATM information is the key to many concepts developed in SESAR. Extensive research was conducted in SESAR 1 under this topic called “System-Wide Information Management (SWIM)”.

Our project addresses the technical infrastructure of SWIM as an enabler to the other projects. It will build on the SESAR 1 research results by integrating the aircraft on the one hand and the military stakeholders on the other hand into the SWIM infrastructure. The aircraft is an essential provider of information with regard to the flight trajectory and an information user, e.g. for meteorological information, which ensures a more efficient flight progress. Integration with the military will contribute to a more complete picture of the traffic situation. Both aspects will improve trajectory based operations and thus improve the experience for the passengers. The common runtime registry will extend the capability of the SESAR 1 SWIM design-time (static) registry by acting as a real-time directory, used to dynamically discover and connect to deployed SWIM services, suited best for the current request during operation, like the internet’s Domain Name Service. This will provide the consumers with an efficient access to the SWIM services, thus facilitating cost-effective operation.

The companies involved in this project are the only ones that can deliver this kind of result. Not on their own – but as the unique cooperation between air navigation service providers and air and ground industry. This ensures the capabilities not only to come up with the concepts and develop prototypes, but also to provide sustainable results usable throughout Europe.",16726898.56,9386744.41,H2020-SESAR-2015-2,SESAR-RIA,THALES LAS FRANCE SAS,FR,"AIRBUS;AUSTRO CONTROL OSTERREICHISCHE GESELLSCHAFT FUR ZIVILLUFTFAHRT MBH;POLSKA AGENCJA ZEGLUGI POWIETRZNEJ;SAAB AKTIEBOLAG;HUNGAROCONTROL MAGYAR LEGIFORGALMISZOLGALAT ZARTKORUEN MUKODO RESZVENYTARSASAG;RIZENI LETOVEHO PROVOZU CESKE REPUBLIKY STATNI PODNIK;STICHTING NATIONAAL LUCHT- EN RUIMTEVAARTLABORATORIUM;STIFTELSEN SINTEF;HONEYWELL AEROSPACE;ENAIRE;VALSTYBES IMONE ORO NAVIGACIJA;EUROCONTROL - EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR THE SAFETY OF AIR NAVIGATION;ATOS BELGIUM;CROATIA CONTROL, CROATIAN AIR NAVIGATION SERVICES LTD;DEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUER LUFT - UND RAUMFAHRT EV;THALES AVS FRANCE SAS;FREQUENTIS AG;INDRA SISTEMAS SA;NATS (EN ROUTE) PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY;DASSAULT AVIATION;LETOVE PREVADZKOVE SLUZBY SLOVENSKEJ REPUBLIKY, STATNY PODNIK;UDARAS EITLIOCHTA NA HEIREANN THE IRISH AVIATION AUTHORITY;LEONARDO - SOCIETA PER  AZIONI;NAVIAIR;LUFTFARTSVERKET;DFS DEUTSCHE FLUGSICHERUNG GMBH;AIRTEL ATN LIMITED",FR;AT;PL;SE;HU;CZ;NL;NO;ES;LT;BE;HR;DE;UK;SK;IE;IT;DK,NA

GreenProtein aims at a major innovation by producing high-added value, food-grade and fully functional proteins and other ingredients, out of vegetal residues mainly from sugar beet. 

The main outcome will be the valorisation of 4,000 tons of agricultural residue /yearly  into a high quality dried RuBisCo powder ready to enter into food industry production chains as an alternative of the widely extended egg white preparations or whey protein. We are the first team worldwide, covering the whole food chain, to design an extraction system of functional RuBisCO. 

The project will design and implement specific equipment to establish a demonstration plant with capacity of 1,500 kg/hour of vegetal residue input, rendering 28 Kg of dry RuBisCO and 82 Kg of dry dietary fibre (25-30% dry matter).

The obtained protein has top valuable functionalities required in food industry, such as gelling, foaming or emulsifying. The outcomes have excellent market projection due to their application in growing consumer needs like high-protein foodstuff, vegan, halal, etc.

Establishing this DEMO plant will allow fine-tuning the extraction process at industrial scale in order to define the optimal conditions for industrial manufacture.

The gold standard in clinical diagnostics is based on the cultivation of bacteria and their phenotypical characterisation. However, these methods are labour-intensive and time-consuming lasting in some cases up to a few weeks. Thus, faster diagnostic techniques are necessary to ensure an immediate and targeted treatment of the patient. DNA-based diagnostics can provide the relevant results within a few hours.
The requirements for a clinical DNA-based characterisation method are high; more than 1000 clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, a few hundred phylogenetic marker genes and virulence factors have to be targeted (including SNP detection). The limit of detection has to be low because a few 100 bacterial cells in the blood system can lead to the death of the patient. It should be possible to analyse a wide range of clinical sample origins such as stool, blood, urine and saliva using the same test. In addition, the results have to be obtained within a single working day.

Buildings are one of the biggest contributors to climate change in Europe and account for over 40% of the EU’s final energy demand and 36% of CO2 emissions. To meet EU’s energy efficiency targets for 2020 and 2030 and long-term goal under the revised EPBD to decarbonise it’s building stock by 2050, renovation becomes crucial, and its rate needs to increase to at least 2-3% per annum.

National Renovation Strategies under the EED aimed to accelerate the rate of renovation, however these have not proved effective. The 2018 recast of the EPBD strengthens the role of these Strategies and obliges MS to set out a roadmap to decarbonised building stock by 2050, supported by a suite of measurable progress indicators and milestones.

BUILD UPON2 proposes to work with local, national and European stakeholders to create a Multi-Level Renovation Impact Framework that contains a suite of milestones and measurable progress indicators for building renovation strategies, integrating data and insights from the city level. This Framework will serve as a tool for Cities in delivering the EPBD and ensure that local initiatives are aligned with national and European policies.

A methodology will be developed to indicate how the Framework reporting system can be integrated into Sustainable Energy Actions Plans (SECAPs), how to use the Framework and how data to support the indicators will be collected and used. The Framework will be tested with 8 pilot cities and the results of this testing phase will be used to update the Framework and create policy recommendations, ensuring that the Framework can be replicated across Europe and help local, regional and national authorities deliver on European energy efficiency goals.

From comprehensive ship operators’ experience and by participation in ongoing work for the European Maritime Safety Agency and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), critical aspects of ro-ro ship fire safety have been identified to form the scope of the project LASH FIRE. It aims to provide a recognized technical basis for the revision of international IMO regulations, which greatly enhances fire prevention and ensures management of fires on ro-ro ships without recourse to external intervention. This is done by developing and demonstrating operational and design solutions which strengthen the fire protection of ro-ro ships in all stages of a fire and which address current and future challenges, including regulatory issues. Twenty specific challenges have been identified, which will be addressed by new solutions developed and demonstrated with regards to performance and ship integration feasibility by system suppliers, researchers, ship owners and shipyards. For the solutions to be considered for regulatory uptake, their impact on risk reduction and cost will be assessed and advisory groups with operators and flag states will be established.

At the same time, datacenter resources require monitoring and management to ensure proper business continuity. To that
extent, IDEAS project will enable datacenters to benefit significantly from the value add of DCIM (datacenter Infrastructure
Management) solutions at a fraction of the cost and complexity of today.
DCIM features will be accessible through a service-oriented business model. These services will address the needs present
during the active life of datacenters and enforce growth of datacenter industry and associated industries across the EU. An
example of this approach is the remote monitoring of the datacenter infrastructure using the intuitive / immersive interface of
IDEAS. It will provide an innovative and competitive answer at a time when the number of datacenters is dramatically
increasing in Europe due to colocation, “cloudification” of enterprise IT, but also new trends such as IoT, 5G that will result in
the surge of very small and scattered datacenters (also known as Edge IT).

Technologies such as data mining and analytics, together with the use of elicitation techniques to gather and analyse information from different stakeholders, allow the generation of actionable knowledge for addressing gender-specific needs for transport decision-making, planning tools and methods. DIAMOND will exploit such technological advances and innovations, to (i) analyse real-world scenarios where these open issues exist, and (ii) take concrete action, to create a fair and inclusive transport system.

DIAMOND’s main goal is to turn data into actionable knowledge with notions of fairness, in order to progress towards an inclusive and efficient transport system. This objective will be achieved by the development of a methodology based on the collection and analysis of disaggregated data, including new sources, analytics and management techniques. Thus this allows to identify, design and evaluate specific measures for fulfilling the needs and expectations of women as users of different transport modes and as jobholders in the sector. The knowledge gathered in the data analysis will then be fed into a toolbox that will provide recommendations on how to achieve fair inclusiveness for women in each of the identified use-cases. Interdisciplinary analysis combining methods from social sciences and computer science will contribute to fairness of the model and its results (i.e. condition of being free from bias or injustice).

To proof actionability, this project will make concrete advances in four real-world scenarios (use-cases) where inclusiveness is currently a central issue: 1.- railways and public multimodal transport, 2.- Vehicle Dynamics control towards autonomous driving, 3.- vehicle sharing and 4.- corporate social responsibility and employment.",2628408.75,2628406,H2020-MG-2018-SingleStage-INEA,RIA,FUNDACIO EURECAT,ES,Systematica S.r.l.;INSTITIUID TEICNEOLAIOCHTA BHAILE ATHA CLIATH;SYNDICAT MIXTE AUTOLIB ET VELIB MÉTROPOLE;Univerzitet u Beogradu - Saobracajni fakultet;MIASTO STOLECZNE WARSZAWA;HEKSAGON MUHENDISLIK VE TASARIM AS;THE UNIVERSITY OF STIRLING;Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya;RINA SERVICES SPA;EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY;GENRE ET VILLE;WAVE WOMEN AND VEHICLES IN EUROPE;TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY DUBLIN;AITEC ASESORES INTERNACIONALES SRL,IT;IE;FR;RS;PL;TR;UK;ES,NA

The objectives will be achieved by stacking ecosystem services to enhance synergistically the effective interplay of the service providers.

Most EU member states lack national level policy and guidance on parking. PARK4SUMP aims to change this, because good parking management has proved to be of utmost importance. It frees the public space, supports local businesses, reduces search travel, generates revenue, increases safety, supports urban planning and can make cities more attractive. The general concept is to take the very best parking management examples, contexts and expertise in Europe, learn and profit from these, and transfer them on a large scale and in the best way possible to new cities . This covers raising awareness and gaining acceptance among relevant stakeholders; building capacity, particularly among cities that have difficulty in picking up such policies; stimulating further innovation; and achieving wide roll-out and transferability. Park4SUMP will work on traffic and travel avoidance; it will support less car dependent lifestyles and put into practise innovations in planning and location policy.  It will also optimise the use of existing infrastructure. Furthermore the modal shift towards more efficient modes like  walking, cycling and public transport will be encouraged. Convincing arguments to incorporate parking management can be given : it has low costs, it pays for itself, it delivers money, it is easy to implement and to modify and it can be done in incremental steps. The main expected impact will be cities with strongly improved parking policies that are creatively used to improve the quality of life and business in cities and develop the cities in a more sustainable way.

The pitfalls of temperature readouts at the biomedical battleground are mostly represented by the currently achievable spatial resolution. To address key issues, such as intracellular temperature fluctuations and in vivo thermal transients, a technique able to go clearly below 1 μm is highly and urgently needed, as the traditional contact-based sensors and near infrared thermometers are not suitable for measurements at that tight spatial range. To overcome these limitations requires a non-contact thermometry approach granted with sub-micrometer resolution, also providing real-time high relative thermal sensitivity values.

The goal of NanoTBTech is to develop a 2-D thermal bioimaging technology featuring sub-microscale resolution, based on nanothermometers and heater-thermometer nanostructures. We will design, synthetize, and bio-functionalize nontoxic luminescent nanostructures, operating essentially beyond 1000 nm, for in vivo nanothermometry and nanoheating. Furthermore, to monitor the temperature-dependent nanostructures’ luminescence we will develop a novel imaging system. The effective delivery of that major advance in 2-D thermal bioimaging will be implemented through two impactful biomedical showcases: highly spatially-modulated intracellular magnetic/optical hyperthermia and in vivo detection and tracking of cancer.

In the long-term, we foresee our technology having a broad impact on non-invasive clinical imaging and theranostics. For instance, the accurate measurement of temperature gradients´ sources will be an invaluable tool for real-time control of thermal therapies, thus making them harmless for the patient.

Because of the lack of sensory feedback amputees experience falls, perceive the prosthesis as a foreign body and therefore do not rely on it during walking. This causes counterbalancing movements that increase fatigue. Both types of patients suffer neuropathic pain, associable to aberrant sensory inputs. Neural pathways between the periphery and the brain are still functional above the damage or the amputation. Targeting these structures with peripheral neural interfaces could allow the restoration of natural sensory functionalities. The aim of project is to develop the first neuroprosthesis restoring natural foot sensations, through sciatic nerve stimulation, to patients with diabetic neuropathy or leg amputation. To that aim we will develop a detailed computational model of the sensory loop of the sciatic nerve. It will merge the electrical stimulation effects on sensory fibers and transduction of mechanical deformations of the skin into action potentials. Modelling results will be validated. Applying this modeling framework we will optimize the geometry of a peripheral neural interface, its surgical placement and define stimulation protocols that mimic natural sensory feedback responses. Effective device for feedback restoration will be constructed, able to translate the signals recorded by sensorized sole placed under the prosthetic or diabetic foot into the natural foot sensations perceived by subject.

Long since cultural heritage is considered as a resource for local development strategies. But there are some contradictions. The sites recognized as cultural heritage are increasing; the costs for functional reuse are growing, while public resources available are becoming scarcer, and private actors are increasingly focused on the short time for payback. The consequence is that there is a growing risk that the decay of heritage will increase year by year because of lack of financial support. Cultural heritage is a non-renewable capital and it is linked to the economy because economics refers to the management of scarce and non-renewable resources; for these reasons, heritage conservation is also an economic choice. 
The CLIC project addresses significant challenges of cultural heritage and landscape adaptive reuse. It progresses the agenda on heritage-led local sustainable development by developing flexible, transparent, integrated and inclusive tools to manage the change of cultural landscape, which are required to leverage the potential of cultural heritage for Europe. The investment gap in cultural heritage and landscape regeneration will be addressed by CLIC through careful evaluation of all costs, of 'complex values' and impacts of adaptive reuse, selecting function(s) not only linked to tourism attractiveness, but also for the well-being improvement, providing critical evidence of wealth, jobs, social, cultural, environmental and economic returns on the investment.
The overarching goal of the CLIC trans-disciplinary research project is to identify evaluation tools to test, implement, validate and share innovative 'circular' financing, business and governance models for systemic adaptive reuse of cultural heritage and landscape, demonstrating the economic, social, environmental convenience, in terms of long lasting economic, cultural and environmental wealth.'",4957033,4957033,H2020-SC5-2017-OneStageB,RIA,CONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHE,IT,UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION;COMUNE DI SALERNO;UNIWERSYTET WARSZAWSKI;GRAD RIJEKA;STICHTING PAKHUIS DE ZWIJGER;GROUPE ICHEC - ISC SAINT-LOUIS - ISFSC;UPPSALA UNIVERSITET;FACILITYLIVE OPCO SRL;VASTRA GOTALANDS LANS LANDSTING;ICLEI EUROPEAN SECRETARIAT GMBH (ICLEI EUROPASEKRETARIAT GMBH)*;UNIVERZA V NOVI GORICI;WIRTSCHAFTSUNIVERSITAT WIEN;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT EINDHOVEN,UK;IT;PL;HR;NL;BE;SE;DE;SI;AT,NA

The project brings together beyond- the-state-of-the-art advances in human biomonitoring and systems biology, exposure monitoring and toxicological testing technologies and advanced tools for computational analyses of the exposure-to-health effect continuum following an exposome paradigm. The NEUROSOME methodology will be applied in population studies across different exposure settings to neurotoxicants (metals and persistent organics) in Europe. This will improve scientific knowledge on cause and-effect relations between environmental stressors and neurodevelopmental disorders taking into account exposure and health effect modification due to intrinsic (e.g. genetic susceptibility) and extrinsic (e.g. diet and socioeconomic status) factors. New standards for human biomonitoring data interpretation in conjunction with environmental and exposure information will be developed for ready use in chemical mixture risk assessment.
The training goal is to produce a new generation of exposome researchers, trained in academia, applied research and industry, with transdisciplinary skills (environmental end exposure modelling, human biomonitoring, -omics technologies, high dimensional bioinformatics and environmental epidemiology,) and understanding of fundamental science and its direct application to environmental health challenges.

The commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has been an important contributor to the increasing share of renewables in the European energy system. Variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, as well as increased end-user flexibility and a market-oriented operation of power plants, results in larger fluctuations in the power system. Hydro power, due to its quick response and storage capability represents an important asset for grid balancing. HydroFlex aims to make hydro power available in a time as short as possible by performing well-focused research and innovation actions on the key bottlenecks of hydro power plants that restricts their flexibility. The project will start off by identifying the operating conditions of hydro power plants in the future energy system. Research will be focused on the flexibility of Francis turbines, the most common turbine type in Europe, and the configuration of synchronous generators and frequency converters that allow for variable speed operation. Variable speed operation increases the operating range of the turbines, reduces the fatigue loads, and allow for higher ramping rates and start-stop-cycles reaching up to 30 times per day. HydroFlex also addresses methods to mitigate the negative effects on downstream water courses that may result from higher flexibility of hydro power plants, by developing and testing a technology for active underground storage of water.

This number will increase dramatically in the near future. This will increase health care spending to a staggering 20% of GDP. Multi-morbidity becomes the number one threat to population health and economic sustainability of health care systems. New models of care for multi-morbid patients are urgently needed. Given the diversity of Europe’s health and social care systems there is no single model that fits them all.

SELFIE aims to improve patient-centred care for patients with multi-morbidity by proposing evidence-based, economically sustainable integrated chronic care (ICC) models that stimulate cooperation across health and social care sectors and are supported by appropriate financing/payment schemes. SELFIE specifically focuses on multi-morbidity, on generating empirical evidence of the impact of ICC and on financing/payment schemes. It is methodologically innovative by applying Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis.

SELFIE develops 5 end-results that are adjustable to different care systems in Europe, including CEE:
1. A taxonomy of most promising ICC models for patients with multi-morbidity; this taxonomy includes a “toolkit” of interventions that policy makers can use to build an ICC model that best fits into their own health and social care system 
2. A detailed list of options for different financing/payment schemes to support the implementation of ICC for multi-morbidity
3. A technical document on price-setting of ICC models for patients with multi-morbidity 
4. A performance assessment tool to monitor goal achievement; this tool includes new indicators that specifically address the quality of care for patients with multi-morbidity

Borrowing sufficiently to bring forward necessary resources to build homes properly both reduces citizens’ “Total Cost of Monthly Ownership” (loan payment plus energy, health and repair costs) while unlocking a critical increase of construction budgets facilitating ownership of the greenest, high-quality homes.  Financing Green Homes with the borrower subject to lower monthly operating costs is less risky to banks which provide discounted credit without harming profits.   
 
The SMARTER project effectively communicates the benefits of Green Homes to citizens and other key stakeholders to bring a systemic solution to a systemic problem that inhibits the financial industry to design and offer green finance products and the citizens to understand and request them. SMARTER replicates a successful “Green Homes and Green Mortgage” program to 12 new countries, addresses barriers and brings green innovation with relevant research and cluster formation, adapts essential tools for administration and communication, and effectively expands collection of actual energy and financial performance to improve risk analysis with local data. Public investment is leveraged and ambitious green EU targets are supported as banks, developers, and green solution providers all contribute budgets to increase private financing for building exemplary homes.   
 
The SMARTER “Green Homes Investment Platform” guides new programs to a suitably ambitious, common definition of green investments and facilitates institutional investment by collaborating with ongoing initiatives including EeMAP and EEFIG; aligning with EC objectives such as “Mainstreaming Energy Efficiency Finance” and advancing the Financial, Technical and Behavioral de-risking championed by “Smart Finance for Smart Buildings'.'",1618195.4,1618195.4,H2020-LC-SC3-EE-2018,CSA,ASOCIATIA ROMANIA GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL,RO,ENERGY EFFICIENCY CENTER - ENEFFECTFOUNDATION;ENERGOEPEKTUROBIS TSENTRI SAKARTVELO;CENTRE FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AND SAVING FONDATION;POLSKIE STOWARZYSZENIE BUDOWNICTWA EKOLOGICZNEGO;CLOVEK V TISNI OPS;UNIVERSITE LIBRE DE BRUXELLES;TURKECO INSAAT ENERJI SANAYI VE TICARET LIMITED SIRKETI;DANMARKS TEKNISKE UNIVERSITET;UDRUZENJE SAVJET ZA ZELENU GRADNJU;SLOVENSKA RADA PRE ZELENE BUDOVY;IRISH GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL LIMITED BY GUARANTEE;GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL ITALIA;ASSOCIATION EUROPEAN-UKRAINIAN ENERGY AGENCY;CRISTOFORETTI SEBASTIANO;ENOVA D.O.O.

Thus, improvements are needed to provide cost effective solutions with high bio-based contents and suitable performances for demanding packaging applications, with a consumption of 19M ton/year, while still achieving compostability in mild conditions.
Using sustainably sourced comonomers, additives and fillers to formulate novel PLA copolymers and compounds, the BIOnTOP project will deliver recyclable-by-design cost competitive packaging solutions that can be mechanically recycled, industrially/home composted or even suitable for anaerobic digestion. 
Moreover, the barrier properties of delivered bio-packaging trays, films and derived packaging, will be enhanced using removable protein-based coatings and a novel fatty acid grafting technology to decrease permeability and compete with fossil packaging.

Digitalization contributes to leverage information sharing, reduce exploitation costs and improve travel experience, but it also blurs the lines between virtual world and reality with serious security matters. In the meanwhile airports face a daily challenge to ensure business continuity and passengers’ safety.
SATIE adopts a holistic approach about threat prevention, detection, response and mitigation in the airports, while guaranteeing the protection of critical systems, sensitive data and passengers. Critical assets are usually protected against individual physical or cyber threats, but not against complex scenarios combining both categories of threats. In order to handle it, SATIE develops an interoperable toolkit which improves cyber-physical correlations, forensics investigations and dynamic impact assessment at airports. Having a shared situational awareness, security practitioners and airport managers collaborate more efficiently to the crisis resolution. Emergency procedures can be triggered simultaneously through an alerting system in order to reschedule airside/landside operations, notify first responders, cybersecurity and maintenance teams towards a fast recovery.
Innovative solutions will be integrated on a simulation platform in order to improve their interoperability and to validate their efficiency. Three demonstrations will be conducted at different corners of Europe (Croatia, Italy and Greece) in order to evaluate the solutions in operational conditions (TRL≥7). Results and best practises will be widely disseminated to the scientific community, standardization bodies, security stakeholders and the aeronautic community.

Typically, they account for 20-30% of the total primary energy requirement of industrialized countries, 40% in EU. Applying the proposed integrated RES to buildings is an important application for wider integration and deployment of renewable energy and to achieving our binding EU targets of at least a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2030, compared to 1990 and at least 27% of renewable energy in EU.   The IDEAS project will create an innovative building integrated renewable energy system (RES) which will cost effectively exceed current RES efficiencies, generating electricity, heat and cooling and optimised for multifamily, public and commercial buildings in different climatic conditions.  The research aim is to create a novel low-cost building integrated RES maximizing the output tuneable for different climatic conditions through novel luminescent and geometric concentrator techniques leading to current solar system efficiencies being exceeded electrically.  Thermally enhancement will be achieved using enhanced organic phase change materials (PCM) with a passive biomimetic heat transfer mechanism for heat storage and discharge. An electrically driven multi-source heat pumpHP system will then use the main energy sources at building scale (waste heat from the system, air and ground), to provide the input to an integrated underfloor heating and hot water system, and to manage the thermal energy storage.

Likewise, reliable rolling stock will be required to crystallize the desired modal shift to rail. Both goals relay on a proactive and cost-effective maintenance and intervention system in the assets.
Assets4Rail aims to contribute to this modal shift by exploring, adapting and testing cutting-edge technologies for railway asset monitoring and maintenance. To achieve that, Assets4Rail follows a twofold approach, including infrastructure (tunnel, bridges, track geometry, and safety systems) and vehicles.
A dedicated information model (BIM) will be the keystone of the infrastructure part of the project. This model with integrated algorithms will gather and analyze the information collected by specific sensors which will monitor subsurface tunnel defects, fatigue consumption, noise and vibrations of bridges as well as track geometry. On the other hand, train monitoring will include the installation of track-side and underframe imaging automated system to collect data for detecting specific types of defects that have non-negligible impacts on infrastructure. The additional use of the RFID technology will enable the smooth identification of trains and single elements, associated with the identified rolling stock failures.
The combination of mentioned real-time collected data with existing data along the implementation of deep learning techniques for assessing large data volumes will pave the way towards a cost-effective and proactive maintenance process of infrastructure and rolling stock. In addition, two innovative intervention methods, noise rail dampers and the cleaning of long tunnel drainage pipes, will be validated on field.

DHs have traditionally been designed to be operated in a hierarchized way, with central energy production facilities delivering heat to a variety of distributed consumption locations.
DHs are identified as key systems to achieve the de-carbonization of heating energy in European Cities. Renewable and waste heat sources are foreseen at the same time as de-carbonized heat sources and the way to guarantee competitive energy costs with limited influence of fossil fuel supply price volatility. To achieve this, conversion of DHs is needed regarding:
- The reduction of their operation temperature to avoid current technical constraints in the integration of low-grade industrial heat sources,
- The introduction of larger shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in the DH network.
- The introduction of distributed heat sources (reject heat from cooling equipment...).
- To guarantee economic viability with the trend of DH heat load reduction due to the evolution of the building stock toward NZEB (Near Zero Energy Buildings).
RELaTED will provide an innovative concept of decentralized Ultra-Low Temperature (ULT) DH networks, which allow for the incorporation of low-grade heat sources with minimal constraints. Also, ULT DH reduce operational costs due to fewer heat losses, better energy performance of heat generation plants and extensive use of de-carbonized energy sources at low marginal costs.
The RELaTED ULT DH concept will be demonstrated in four complementary operation environments (new and existing DH, locations, climatic conditions, dimension…) in Denmark, Estonia, Serbia and Spain.
RELaTED approach will follow the strategy of the electrical smart grids, in which energy generation is decentralized and consumers evolve to prosumers (they consume and produce energy).",4755475,3943251.26,H2020-EE-2017-RIA-IA,IA,FUNDACION TECNALIA RESEARCH & INNOVATION,ES,"INDUSTRIAS IMAR, S.A.;NIBE AKTIEBOLAG;BEOGRADSKE ELEKTRANE;GOBIERNO VASCO - DEPARTAMENTO SEGURIDAD;FEDERATION EUROPEENNE DES AGENCES ET DES REGIONS POUR L'ENERGIE ET L'ENVIRONNEMENT;TEKNOLOGISK INSTITUT;EL TALLER DE COMUNICACION Y CIA S.COOP.

Complex, distinctive changes occur in the glycomics profiles or - Glycan Signatures - of human glycoproteins during progression of many chronic diseases including cancer and inflammatory conditions. The three beneficiaries of the GlySign Consortium have been instrumental in contributing to knowledge in this field through development of glycomics technology and discovery of clinically important novel glycan biomarkers in a variety of diseases. 
Glycan signatures have great potential for adding useful diagnostic and prognostic information in PM. However, advancement of this field is slow because (a) glycans have immense structural complexity resulting in major technical challenges for their analysis and (b) there is a lack of experts with required glycoanalytical skills. GlySign will address this gap by training six young scientists within an innovative training-by-research programme with high industrial-academic mobility to eventually push forward the translation of novel glycomics-based diagnostic tools into clinical practice. This will be achieved by further developing a range of selective and sensitive glycomics technologies for the analysis of samples from patients and healthy controls in close collaboration between industry/academia as well as clinical chemists and clinicians who will be the end users of GlySign’s final products. To this end, we will focus the training on clinical glycomics applied to four model diseases implicating changes in the glycosylation of circulating proteins specific to disease progression or subtype, i.e. diabetes, prostate cancer, fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and rheumatoid arthritis. Due to its strong industrial and translational focus, GlySign will, moreover, fill a current gap in the market by establishing new in vitro diagnostic platforms for clinical exploitation of glycomic biomarkers for PM.",1552846.32,1552846.32,H2020-MSCA-ITN-2016,MSCA-ITN-EID,ACADEMISCH ZIEKENHUIS LEIDEN,NL,LUDGER LIMITED;GENOS DOO ZA VJESTACENJE I ANALIZU,UK;HR,NA

The project will expand the outlook and debate on STI issues, increase scientific literacy in a broad sense, which includes the understanding of the societal role of Science, Technology and innovation (STI), and create shared understanding between scientific stakeholders, policy-makers and citizens. This multi-actor approach will embrace EU28 plus Norway and Switzerland.

The CIMULTACT builds on the principle/conviction that the collective intelligence of society gives Europe a competitive advantage, which may be activated to strengthen the relevance of the European science and technology system. By establishing genuine dialogue between citizens, stakeholders, scientists, and policymakers visions and scenarios for the desirable futures will be developed and debated, and transformed into recommendations and suggestions for research and innovation policies and topics. 

In short, CIMULACT will
● Create vision and scenarios that connect societal needs with future expected advances in Science and their impact on technology, society, environment etc. in connection to the grand challenges
● Provide concrete input to Horizon 2020 through recommendations and policy options for R&I and simulated calls for the Horizon2020 Work Programmes.
● Engage citizens and stakeholders in a highly participatory debate/consultation/process on scenarios for desirable sustainable futures and research
● Build capacities in citizen and multi-actor engagement in R&I through development, experimentation, training and assessment of methods for engagement
● Facilitate dialogue and shared understanding between policymakers, citizens, and stakeholders
● Reveal  the relative merits of the citizen focussed consultations",3414383.08,3299701.83,H2020-ISSI-2014-1,CSA,FONDEN TEKNOLOGIRADET,DK,"RTD TALOS LIMITED;TEKNOLOGIRADET - THE NORWEGIAN BOARD OF TECHNOLOGY;GREENDEPENDENT INTEZET NONPROFIT KOZHASZNU KORLATOLT FELELOSSEGU TARSASAG;ATLANTIS SYMVOULEFTIKI ANONYMI ETAIREIA ATLANTIS CONSULTING SA;HELSINGIN YLIOPISTO;UDRUGE ODRAZ-ODRZIVI RAZVOJ ZAJEDNICE;SLOVENIAN BUSINESS & RESEARCH ASSOCIATION;INSTYTUT TECHNOLOGII EKSPLOATACJI-PANSTWOWY INSTYTUT BADAWCZY;FRAUNHOFER GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.V.;ASOCIATIA INSTITUTUL DE PROSPECTIVA;FUNDACIO CATALANA PER A LA RECERCA I LA INNOVACIO;APPLIED RESEARCH AND COMMUNICATIONS FUND;MISSIONS PUBLIQUES;STATENS GEOTEKNISKA INSTITUT;STRATEGIC DESIGN SCENARIOS SPRL;AKADEMIEN DER WISSENSCHAFTEN SCHWEIZ VEREIN;SIA BALTIJAS KONSULTACIJAS;MEDIATEDOMAIN LDA;POLITECNICO DI MILANO;UNIVERSITA TA MALTA;ASOCIACIJA ZINIU EKONOMIXOS FORUMAS;4MOTION ASBL;THE ASSOCIATION FOR SCIENCE AND DISCOVERY CENTRES LBG;SLOVENSKA AKADEMIA VIED;OESTERREICHISCHE AKADEMIE DER WISSENSCHAFTEN;TECHNOLOGICKE CENTRUM AKADEMIE VED CESKE REPUBLIKY;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK -  NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, CORK;STICHTING WAGENINGEN RESEARCH",CY;NO;HU;EL;FI;HR;BE;PL;DE;RO;ES;BG;FR;SE;CH;LV;PT;IT;MT;LT;LU;UK;SK;AT;CZ;IE;NL,NA

Relying on district heating systems for heat generation is the most effective solution in densely populated areas. However, many district heating systems (DHS) are highly energy inefficient and need to be modernized. Considering that the predominant energy sources used are still fossil fuels (oil, gas or coal) makes interventions ever more urgent. Both statements hold especially for East European countries where old, inefficient district heating systems, mostly fueled by fossil sources, urgently need to be modernized. 

The unique feature of KeepWarm is its combination of concrete work at pilot systems and its close alignment with national and European multipliers to disseminate this experience broadly. The latter incudes close interaction with potential investors and fund managers to increase the likelihood that KeepWarm business plans receive the necessary funding. The project promotes EU goals of improved and environmental friendly heating and cooling but adapts its exploitation strategy to distinct national windows of opportunities.

KeepWarm will work intensively with DHS in seven countries (i) to increase the energy efficiency of these systems; and (ii) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting a switch from fossil to renewable fuels. This is most urgently needed in the case of large-scale DH systems that are mostly found in Eastern Europe, the focus of this project. Likewise, it is important to ensure that existing DHS that run on renewables do not switch back to fossil fuels.",2098497.5,2098488.5,H2020-EE-2017-CSA-PPI,CSA,DEUTSCHE GESELLSCHAFT FUR INTERNATIONALE ZUSAMMENARBEIT (GIZ) GMBH,DE,"LLC KT-ENERGY;INSTITUT JOZEF STEFAN;LANDESKAMMER FUER LAND UND FORTWIRTSCHAFT IN STEIERMARK;BIEDRIBA ZEMGALES REGIONALA ENERGETIKAS AGENTURA;INSTITUT ZA NUKLEARNE NAUKE VINCA;REGIONALNA ENERGETSKA AGENCIJA SJEVEROZAPADNE HRVATSKE;ZAVOD ENERGETSKA AGENCIJA ZA SAVINJSKO SALESKO IN KOROSKO;ICLEI EUROPEAN SECRETARIAT GMBH (ICLEI EUROPASEKRETARIAT GMBH)*;TEPLARENSKE SDRUZENI CESKE REPUBLIKY;SVEUCILISTE U ZAGREBU, FAKULTET STROJARSTVA I BRODOGRADNJE",UA;SI;AT;LV;RS;HR;DE;CZ,NA

OSTEOproSPINE is a novel bone regeneration therapy composed of OSTEOGROW (recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 6 [rhBMP6] delivered in autologous peripheral blood coagulum) reinforced with allograft (a compression resistant matrix). OSTEOproSPINE is designed to guide the formation of new bone at extra-skeletal site and replace autograft harvested from patient’s iliac crest for the fusion of lumbar vertebrae. By generating new bone, OSTEOproSPINE will restore the spine’s weight bearing function, reduce the severity of back pain and improve the success rate of posterolateral spinal fusion surgery. The program consortium of 13 partners from 6 EU member states has been assembled to conduct a Phase II, randomized, patient- and evaluator-blinded clinical trial of OSTEOproSPINE. Four clinical centers will enroll 180 patients suffering from degenerative disc disease to assess OSTEOproSPINE efficacy and safety in comparison with Standard of care (autograft) and Osteogrow. The Ethics Committee of the leading clinical site in Vienna has already granted a conditional approval for this trial. As the coordinating institution of the FP7 HEALTH project Osteogrow (Grant No. 279239), we have evaluated Osteogrow in Phase I/II clinical trials for distal radius fracture and high tibial osteotomy. Osteogrow exhibited excellent safety profile in these trials, supporting OSTEOproSPINE safety for administration in humans. A positive outcome of proposed trial will confirm OSTEOproSPINE potential to form a functioning new bone in human and by this restore the spine’s function and improve the quality of life in patients with degenerative disc disorders using the ground principle of regenerative medicine: “provide the correct molecular signals to a population of presumptive cells in a permissive microenvironment”.",6004152.5,6004152.5,H2020-SC1-2017-Single-Stage-RTD,RIA,SVEUCILISTE U ZAGREBU MEDICINSKI FAKULTET,HR,MEDIZINISCHE UNIVERSITAET WIEN;2KMM SPOLKA Z OGRANICZONA ODPOWIEDZIALNOSCIA;MEDIZINISCHE UNIVERSITAT GRAZ;PAUL REGULATORY SERVICES LIMITED;CLINRES FARMACIJA RAZISKAVE DOO;EURICE EUROPEAN RESEARCH AND PROJECT OFFICE GMBH;OPCA BOLNICA VARAZDIN;UNIVERSITAT LINZ;QBEX GMBH;SMART-MEDICO DOO;UNIVERSITY OF ZAGREB-FACULTY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE;TRIADELTA PARTNERI DOO ZA ISTRAZIVANJE I RAZVOJ;GENERA ISTRAZIVANJA DRUSTVO S OGRANICENOM ODGOVORNOSCU ZA PROIZVODNJU BIOTEHNOLOSKIH PROIZVODA,AT;PL;UK;SI;DE;HR,NA

It is projected that it will account for 46% of United States gas supply by 2035.  It has revolutionized the US economy by creating 600,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributed $49 billion annually to government revenues. With only a handful of well rigs (72 in Europe compared to over 2000 in the US as of 2012); Europe is 8-10 years behind the USA.
The most imminent challenge for oil and gas industry in Europe (and the rest of the world) is therefore being able to demonstrate/guarantee safe exploration and extraction techniques in order to address the associated environmental concerns. The ideal way to do this will be by continuously monitoring environmental conditions and effects (including in the long term) of the underground soil and water in-situ during exploration to be able to effectively mitigate for the soil and aquifer contamination by methane gas and fracking chemicals in the possible event that they occur. With reports in the U.S. of cases where mistakes were made, this is a possibility. This problem has led to a fragmented political landscape regarding shale gas, with Poland being a main backer; the U.K., Lithuania and Romania moving cautiously ahead and others being hesitant. 
Currently, soil and water inspection is done by testing samples in the lab which is expensive and time consuming. In the FP7 SOIMON project, a soil monitoring system embedded in a sonic drilling pipe has been developed and tested in the field. The system allows soil monitoring while drilling a hole in the soil. This system, used in ShaleSafe, allows monitoring of the soil and groundwater above the shale gas reservoir and around the shale gas well by performing  monitoring in hydrogeological wells.

Nowadays, it is a fact that Europe is ageing. A common characteristic of elders is the frequent occurrence of either physical or mild cognitive impairments. This situation brings new challenges in how to improve the independence and quality of life of elderly people and promote their good health in different ways. The ehcoBUTLER project addresses this challenge by developing an ICT technological platform with both leisure and care apps. The main objective of ehcoBUTLER is to demonstrate the socio-economic benefits from the deployment of several innovative and user led ICT pilot projects based on different business models in order to be able to translate promising results into scalable practice across Europe.

How the objectives will be achieved:

Hinged on a yearly Failing Forward conference, the project will 
- map out all the relevant stakeholders and programs in each of the partnering areas in a systematic way, making this available to all web entrepreneurs across Europe in one centralized platform,
- identify, share and discuss best practices & success stories

The project aims to achieve the following two goals: 1) mutual support and thus raising the general standard of applicants (taking into account the diversity of the different actors) 2) to better inform the research and innovation stakeholders on funding possibilities in the MSCA and help them to improve their  performance. Thus, ultimately our goal is to support research and innovation. As a synergy effect, the work processes of REA, EC and NCPs will be optimized and more effective. 
The project will help less experienced NCPs to improve their service so that their beneficiaries become more competitive. Less experienced NCPs shall be able to rapidly acquire knowledge from the community of MSCA NCPs. Net4Mobility has to raise awareness of MSCA funding possibilities in the non-academic and the academic sectors, especially for the new funding schemes or new modes in existing ones. 
The project will achieve these goals by the implementation of a wide array of measures, e.g.: 
- Trainings based on the needs of MSCA NCPs in particular with regards to the challenges of Horizion2020 
- 'Twinning' visits and Best Practice Meetings to tap into the already existing knowledge of MSCA NCPs 
- Communication platforms for the constant exchange and transfer of knowledge

Micro-firms make a particularly small contribution, providing only 10% of value added, 11 percentage points lower than in the EU .
Regarding the movement of the total innovation index (SII-Summary Innovation Index), it can be concluded that the innovative performance of the Republic of Serbia indicates a certain increase, since SII for the Republic of Serbia in 2016 was 64,2 compared to 46,8 in 2010. Also, the innovative performance in Serbia is still below the average of EU-28 (102 for the same year). However, regarding SII index for the period of 2010–2016 in the neighbouring countries, it can be concluded that the situation in Serbia is more favourable compared to Bulgaria, Macedonia (FYROM), Romania and Croatia, but less favourable compared to Slovenia or Hungary .

The focus of the events is to highlight to young people, pupils and students the importance of innovation and creativity processes in research for the benefit of the society. The coordinator of the project is Business Innovation Croatian Agency (BICRO), the key governmental agency for innovation in science and SME sector, focusing on high-technology. BICRO, together with three selected partners: Society znanost.org, University of Split, and Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing at University of Zagreb will bring successful researchers with high innovation track records closer to the public at large, especially pupils and students in Croatia.  

The project  intends to stimulate student's understanding and interest towards science and research as an attractive career and in general to enhance public recognition of researchers and their work in Croatia. The format of two events to be organized in two largest cities in Croatia (Zagreb and Split) for two consecutive years allows a unique swap of 10 central Eureka modules between the cities: the Modules organized and presented iin Split in 2014 will be moved to Zagreb in 2015, and Zagreb’s events in 2014 will be presented in Split 2015.  

Various activities during the Nights will be adapted and suited  for a wide audience and will include different competitions, many Modules with science shows, scientist animators, exhibitions, projections, stands and many other surprises.

In an intelligent way the weakness of the PEO process (the inherent porosity due to the discharges forming the coating is often responsible for poor properties) is used to functionalize the coating using the open pore structure as a reservoir for nanocontainer or to bring particles with certain functionalities deep into the coatings (fast pathways). The main targeted functionalities, are enhanced fault tolerance and active protection against corrosive damage as well as improved tribological behavior. Moreover, to extend this typical field of applications of PEO treatments and address additional industries and aspects (e.g. 3C, ecological), a set of less common functionalities, such as photocatalytic, magnetic, thermo- and electroconductivity will be added. This is challenging and goes far beyond the state-of-the-art introduction via post-treatments. To deal with such sensitive materials, changes in the power supply are required and this is addressed as one of the key points in frame of the project as well.
The essential key of the project is the formation and development of an interdisciplinary R&D partnership, where participants from both academia (5) and private sector (4 SME) participate, promoting and sharing their ideas, expertise, techniques and methods to solve this demanding challenge. This partnership will be beneficial for all participants, since new PEO hardware, environmentally friendly processes and applications important for industry are developed, evaluated and promoted by the research institutions via presentations and publications of the obtained results. Laboratory based training and intersectional transfer of knowledge are the key aspects of the FUNCOAT project, so the partnership gathers the topmost competences to carry out the suggested research program.",1301800,1301800,H2020-MSCA-RISE-2018,MSCA-RISE,HELMHOLTZ-ZENTRUM GEESTHACHT ZENTRUM FUR MATERIAL- UND KUSTENFORSCHUNG GMBH,DE,FACULTY OF PHYSICS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE;SMALLMATEK - SMALL MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES LDA;COMPANY FOR TRADE AND SERVICES CHEMICAL AGROSAVA DOO BELGRADE (NOVI BEOGRAD);UNIVERSIDADE DE AVEIRO;TEHNOLABOR OU;MEOTEC GMBH & CO KG,RS;PT;EE;DE,NA

To grow 1 tonne of mushroom, 3 to 4 tonnes of substrate are needed. However, when mushroom production is completed the substrate cannot be used for another growing cycle due to the depletion of nutrients needed for mushroom growing and it is called Spent Mushroom Substrate (SMS) and becomes a waste that should be managed according to regulations. In Europe, c.a. 3.65 million tons of SMS are generated each year. SMS is a high-moisture content bulk material rich in organic matter and nutrients and it could be reused in agriculture by adding it to the soils as amendment or mulch or weathered to be reused as casing soil. However, nitrates directive set a disposal limit that makes that large quantities of SMS cannot be simply spread in soils next to growers’ facilities, as there is a high risk of leachates and water pollution. Due to its low bulk density and high water content, transportation costs are high and therefore storage is becoming a sound problem. SmartMUSHROOM aims to increase mushroom growers’ waste management efficiency by using a new technology which allow them to obtain enough biogas from fresh SMS to dry a mixture of digestate and additional fresh SMS and pelletize it targeting to obtain a marketable high-quality organic fertilizer rich in organic matter and in nutrients, easy to handle, store and transport to any farming region in Europe. A perfect example of biobased circular economy. The aim of the project is to build a pilot plant to demonstrate the technology and find the best commercial formulation for the pellets to enter organic farming market. After the end of project we aim to build at least 18 treatment plants that will place in market 153,000 tonnes of SMS-pellets, generating a total Turnover of 54M€ in the period 2021-2025 and up to 105 related new jobs.",3002793.75,2264143.13,H2020-EIC-FTI-2018-2020,IA,ASOCIACION PROFESIONAL DE PRODUCTORES DE SUSTRATOS Y HONGOS DE LA RIOJA NAVARRA Y ARAGON,ES,NOVIS GMBH;ECOSOIL DRUSTVO SA OGRANICENOM ODGOVORNOSCU GRKINJA;INVESTIGACION Y DESARROLLO CASTILLA Y LEON SL,DE;RS;ES,NA

This will enable the integration of different administrative levels and geographical planning areas as well as enhance the cost efficiency in the entire planning and implementation process based on economic of scale and closer cooperation and exchange. In addition regional PentaHelix
Task forces will be established, involving key stakeholder and target groups, that will serve as a driver for a wider scope of the SECAPs as well as bringing in valuable insights and identification of potential measures, system solutions and a better understanding of drivers and barriers for a more sustainable society as a whole, in each specific region.
This PentaHelix approach will be developed and tested in 8 pilot municipalities in Norway, Croatia, Belgium, Spain and Latvia. Each region is unique in terms of demography, economy, urban development, climate conditions and industrial/ businesss structure. Together these pilot areas consititutes a large number of inhabitants and potential mitigation of CO2 and energy savings. To further enhance the impact of the project a broad replication and dissemination strategy and actions will be rolled out in many countries in the EU. This will be mainly carried out towards neighboring regions as well as the network of ERRIN with it's many member organisations. Targeted dissemination actions will be implemented. 11 partners from 5 countries will do this during 36 months.",1808343.75,1808343.75,H2020-EE-2017-CSA-PPI,CSA,"SVEUCILISTE U ZAGREBU, FAKULTET STROJARSTVA I BRODOGRADNJE",HR,DIPUTACION DE AVILA;INTERCOMMUNALE VOOR ONTWIKKELING VAN HET GEWEST MECHELEN EN OMGEVING;EUROPEAN BUSINESS AND INNOVATION CENTRE NETWORK AISBL;OSTFOLD FYLKESKOMMUNE;WEST-VLAAMSE INTERCOMMUNALE;BIEDRIBA ZEMGALES REGIONALA ENERGETIKAS AGENTURA;REGIONALNA ENERGETSKA AGENCIJA SJEVEROZAPADNE HRVATSKE;CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK EUROPE ASBL;JEKABPILS PILSETAS PASVALDIBA;ENTE PUBLICO REGIONAL DE LA ENERGIA DE CASTILLA Y LEON,ES;BE;NO;LV;HR,NA

There are different good quality methodologies and guidelines available. However, currently municipalities struggle to implement these action plans. There are different reasons for that; one of the most important is the fact that often municipal employees do not feel engaged and are not motivated to take any sort of actions and initiatives, unless someone has actually “obliged” them. In many cases, this lack of engagement and commitment ends up with investments in energy efficiency that do not deliver expected technical and economic outcomes. Hence, the energy efficiency potential is not fully exploited and worse suboptimal investments do not provide expected yields. Moreover, local authorities (LAs) more often are facing also challenges regarding climate resilient infrastructure and climate adaptation. The level of knowledge and understanding is even scarcer as regarding climate mitigation. 
COMPETE4SECAP is designed to deliver a systematic approach to energy savings in local authorities using energy management systems (EnMS) according to ISO 50001 or European Energy Award with dedicated online monitoring tool and energy saving competitions. EnMS and competitions when combined can trigger significant benefits by providing innovative and efficient way to involve municipalities that have already their SEAPs but do not act in order to foster their integrated development at local level. Trained and engaged municipal employees will be able to better implement energy efficiency projects, which then require higher investments. An EnMS will help the LA to have reliable data for informed decision and further help in monitoring and evaluation of implemented projects. The use of renewable energy and integration of climate adaptation will also be facilitated through EnMS with the set of procedures from an environmental management system (e.g. IS0 140001).",1784983.75,1784983.75,H2020-EE-2016-CSA,CSA,EKODOMA,LV,"GREENDEPENDENT INTEZET NONPROFIT KOZHASZNU KORLATOLT FELELOSSEGU TARSASAG;EUROVERTICE CONSULTORES SL;SOGESCA s.r.l.;B. & S.U.

The SESAR approach towards this goal is the introduction of a 4D-trajectory, which is common across all ATM stakeholders, called Reference Business Trajectory (RBT). The Flight Object concept is seen as a key enabler for implementing the RBT for Air Navigation Service Providers. The main objective of PJ27 is the demonstration that Flight Object Interoperability works in a real world upper En-route airspace environment of Air Traffic Control Centers (ACCs) from DFS, DSNA, ENAV and EUROCONTROL over spanning a large area of European core airspace. The demonstration will be executed as a set of Shadow Mode trials during which Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) will use Flight Object and SWIM equipped systems and perform flight coordination and transfer operations on the current air traffic as well as fallback operations. The only difference to real operations is that the ATCOs clearances will not be sent to the real aircraft. The project will assess the benefits of the Flight Object to improve ATM Network performance and situational awareness supporting demand and capacity balancing between and within the participating ACCs. The demonstration is expected to provide a proof that the Flight Object Concept is ready for deployment as required in the AF#5 of the PCP Regulation (EU) No 716/2014. This demonstration is an important milestone for Air Navigation Service Providers and the Network Manager, because it will constitute an ultimate step of validation before these stakeholders will start PCP AF#5 deployment activities. Finally the demonstration will provide valuable input into the SESAR Deployment Programme which will facilitate the coordination of PCP AF#5 deployment roadmaps and deployment scenarios.'",9693962.5,1233047.49,H2020-SESAR-2015-2,SESAR-IA,DFS DEUTSCHE FLUGSICHERUNG GMBH,DE,"AUSTRO CONTROL OSTERREICHISCHE GESELLSCHAFT FUR ZIVILLUFTFAHRT MBH;DIRECTION DES SERVICES DE LA NAVIGATION AERIENNE;ENAV SPA;ENTIDAD PUBLICA EMPRESARIAL ENAIRE;EUROCONTROL - EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR THE SAFETY OF AIR NAVIGATION;CROATIA CONTROL, CROATIAN AIR NAVIGATION SERVICES LTD;INDRA SISTEMAS SA;THALES LAS FRANCE SAS;UDARAS EITLIOCHTA NA HEIREANN THE IRISH AVIATION AUTHORITY;LEONARDO - SOCIETA PER  AZIONI;NAVIAIR;LUFTFARTSVERKET",AT;FR;IT;ES;BE;HR;IE;DK;SE,NA
